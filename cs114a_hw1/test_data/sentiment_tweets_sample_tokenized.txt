@USAirways Trying to change my flight due to NYC travel advisory ... your online system Cancelled Flighted my entire flight . Been on hold for over 1 hr
@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage . Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
@USAirways should give me free baggage for this mess
@JetBlue C'm on now . My flight 's delayed annnnnd you ca n't give me a pick ? ! ? I 'm about to tweet at @united or @Delta .......
@USAirways any way to get your call center to answer for a OneWorld award ? Whenever try system says too busy and disconnect or endless hold
@SouthwestAir no flights out of # nashville today ? Are you kidding me ? ! ? ! Why are other airlines flying and you 're not ? ! So frustrated ! !
@AmericanAir another generic response guys ? Cmon . You 're terrible . How about an actual helpful person ? Not all the rude employees at LAX
@united three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats ...
@united really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight & amp ; -going via Nashville ? # inconvenience . Downgraded but not on ticket
@united nice 2 see U have a sense of humor . # 3hourdelay Just want 2 B home but I 'll settle for that beer . Once safely in the air , of course
@JetBlue @lopezlaymari what a patronizing response to a legitimate issue
@AmericanAir Thanks ! Bleh , disconnected ! Let 's try this again ! !
@JetBlue thank you ! Hopefully it 's soon ! We are supposed to leave at 11:23
@United . What 's going on with UA 236 ? outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be ? # worst2unitedflightsever
@USAirways claimed my flight Cancelled Flighted because PHL runway not good but Delta flight at same exact time is taking off on time .
@united Step 1 : Cancelled Flight flight . Step 2 : Do n't notify customer . Step 3 : Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait . Brilliant .
@AmericanAir @USAirways So who do I need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so I can get the credit for the charges ?
@JetBlue Cancelled Flightling tickets for 3 best friends going on vacation and never told us # jetblue # fixthis # ripoff @ZKatcher @bretharold
@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting ... that was the hurry ..
@SouthwestAir last 5 flights have all consistently ran behind schedule what 's up with that ? ?
@united your service need work - check out this Bush airport " customer service line " last nt # unitedagainstunited
@USAirways plz plz plz hold 4438 to EYW . The 810 PHL & gt;CLT is sooo Late Flight . Gon na miss the connection for @jabevan221 's 40th # GTH239
@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
@united I was denied use of a rear facing car seat on UA5025 , an ERJ145 . Can you confirm the actual policy ?
@SouthwestAir the person I talked to could n't do anything not normally available online other than the " no charge " part .
@JetBlue do nt really know what that means but this is nt the best first - time - flying - w - a-16mo old experience . likelihood of addtl delays 2nt ?
@SouthwestAir so why is every single flight out of @PortColumbusCMH Cancelled Flightled for only your airline ?
@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there 's a long line for deicing ... Still need to improve service # united
@AmericanAir one staff on desk . Now been queuing for over an hr .
@AmericanAir got off the phone w/ rep now flight has disappeared . Locator IRRLCD she said I was rescheduled . Help please .
@SouthwestAir I 'm smashed into a window by the giant guest sitting next to me . # 4386 . No way this guy should have been given 1 seat .
@JetBlue that 's where we all get on the same page . Cancelled Flighted it 45 mins ago . @delta @SouthwestAir help flights from @tfgreenairport to MCO ?
@united you asked me to DM then ignore them . Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD .
@AmericanAir keep trying to call to change reservation and you keep hanging up on me
@AmericanAir so great AA1103 sitting for an hour first technical problems now what ?
@USAirways Thank you glad to be home . There were lots of delays with the plane and flight crew did n't show up . It was very frustrating .
@united 100 % I will put together a very serious email , with all the issues that arose on our vacation due to your staff I will post it here
@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight , and now we are stranded .
@united You make it hard to fly with you . Delayed over an hour and now the plane is turning around & amp ; heading back to the gate . # connection ?
@united what incentive do I have to give you another chance ?
@SouthwestAir most other carriers were flying out way past SW Cancelled Flightlation . @AlaskaAir and @JetBlue got their passengers out much Late Flightr ! ! ! ! !
@USAirways on flight # 556 delayed#connection help for flight # 561 # help via email
.@AmericanAir cover a rental car or refund our ticket ? - I 'll gladly drive 10 hrs home than be stuck here till Tues !
@USAirways I packed a carry on for a reason . Thanks for making me check it . I hoped for better customer service in CLE also . # nothappy
@AmericanAir Right . But more than two hours Late Flight , and it seems due to poor communication , which sounded like it was annoying on - plane staff
@united they let us board again but will we fly this time ? Who knows ! # shouldhaveflowndelta
@JetBlue I had 2 fight 2 get a credit for the value of my bag but I got it . # skytrax # jetblue # corpgreed # nevertakeno
@united flt 4567 no gate agent , no announcements . So unprofessional . Time to go back to @Delta
@SouthwestAir TSA Pre is n't showing up on my boarding passes and I 've followed all of the steps . Please help .
can you not ? RT @JetBlue Our fleet 's on fleek .
@united if I pay you $ 25 and $ 35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive . Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery ?
@AmericanAir trying to change flight via DFW tomorrow , ca n't get thru on phone , long wait then cut off x2 , can you help please ?
@AmericanAir five times at last count
@JetBlue I 'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey .
@AmericanAir @BDinDallas The personal touch you 're known for , AA . Other cool perks : blaming understaffing on weather . And 3 hr hold times .
@USAirways : You Make the Reservation ; We 'll Make the Excuses ! # usairwaysfail
@AmericanAir been waiting on hold for more than an hour
@united & lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-------- do not reply to emails ?
@united is horrible ! ! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat , safety regulations say it 's illegal to use a used car seat
@AmericanAir I 've been trying to get through to reservations since yesterday to make a change to a reservation hold , when will it be up ?
