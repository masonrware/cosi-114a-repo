Girls of fifteen
Sexually knowing
The ushers are sniffing
Eau de Cologning
The seats are seductive
Celibate sitting
Pretty girls digging
Prettier women
Magically bored on a quiet street corner
Free frustration in our minds and our toes
Quiet storm water , m-m-my generation
Uppers and downers , either way blood flows
Inside outside Leave me alone
Inside outside Nowhere is home
Inside outside Where have I been ?

Holy hitching

Birthday punching
He man drag in a glittering ballroom
Greyly outrageous in my high heel shoes
Tightly undone , know what they're showing
Sadly ecstatic that their heros are news

Mother was an incubator
Father was the contents
Of a test tube in the ice box
In the factory of birth
My name is
And I've just become alive
I'm the newest populator
Of the planet we call Earth
In suspended animation
My childhood passed me by
If I speak without emotion
Then you know the reason why
Knowledge of the universe
Was fed into my mind
As my adolescent body
Left its puberty behind
And everything I know is what I need to know
And everything I do's been done before
Every sentence in my head
Someone else has said
At each end of my life is an open door
Automatically defrosted
When manhood came on time
I became a man
I left the ice school behind
Now I'm to begin
The life that I'm assigned
A life that's been used before
A thousand times
I have a feeling deep inside
That something is missing
It's a feeling in my soul
And I can't help wishing
That one day I'll discover
That we're living a lie
And I'll tell the whole world
The reasons why
But until then , all I know is what I need to know
Everything I do's been done before
Every idea in my head
Someone else has said
At each end of my life is an open door
ABBIE HOFFMAN :
I think this is a pile of shit ! While John Sinclair rots in prison !
PETE TOWNSHEND :
Fuck off ! Eh ! Fuck off my fucking stage!
I told you why I changed my mind
I got bored by playing with time
I know you thought you had me nailed
But I've freed my head from your garden rails
Now it's a legal matter , baby
You got me on the run
It's a legal matter , baby
A legal matter from now on
My mind's lost in a household fog
Wedding gowns and catalogs
Kitchen furnishings and houses
Maternity clothes and babies' trousers
Now it's a legal matter , baby
Marryin's no fun
It's a legal matter , baby
A legal matter from now on
You ain't the first and you ain't the last
I gain and lose my women fast
I never want to make them cry
I just get bored , don't ask me why
Just want to keep doing all the dirty little things I do
And not work all day in an office just to bring my money back to you
Sorry , baby
They say that love often passes in a second
And you never can catch it up
So I'm hanging on to you as though eternity beckoned
But it's clear that the match is rough
Common sense 'd tell me not to try 'n continue
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you
So keep an eye open
My spirit ain't broken
Your love's so incredible
Your body so edible
You give me an overdose of love
Just a little is a enough
I'm connoisseur of champagne cognac
The perfume nearly beats the taste
I eat an oyster and I feel the contact
But more than one would be a waste
Some people want an endless line that's true
But all I have is a little time with you
A smile sets me reeling
A kiss feels like stealing
Your love is like heroin
This addict is mellowing
I can't pretend that I'm tough
Just a little is enough
Just like a sailor heading into the seas
There's a gale blowing in my face
The high winds scare me but I need the breeze
And I can't head for any other place
Life would seem so easy on the other tack
But even a hurricane won't turn me back
You might be an island
On the distant horizon
But the little I see
Looks like heaven to me
I don't care if the ocean gets rough
Just a little is enough
Common sense 'd tell me not to try and continue
But I'm after a piece of that diamond in you
So keep an eye open
My spirit ain't broken
Your love's so incredible
Your body so edible
You give me an overdose of love
A little is enough
What's mine is mine
What's yours is yours , and what's mine is mine
What's yours is yours , and what's mine is mine
What's yours is yours , and what's mine is mine
I don't care
I know you're gonna hate this song
With that said
We never really got along
It's not new , not diverse
It won't light up your parade
It's just simple verse
All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
I'm long gone
And I ain't never coming back
Who once swung
I never really quite got black
I'm not blue , I'm not pink
I'm just grey , I'm afraid
And it seems in a blink
All this music will fade
All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
Just like the edge of a blade
All this music will fade
All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
Just like the edge of a blade
What's yours is yours , and what's mine is mine
What's mine is yours , and what's yours is mine
What's mine is yours , and what's yours is mine
What's yours is yours , and what's mine is mine
I don't mind
Other guys ripping off my song
I'd be a liar
If I said I never done no wrong
Oh , this sound that we share
Has already been played
And it hangs in the air
All this music will fade
All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
Just like the edge of a blade
All this music will fade
All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
I don't care
I know you're gonna hate this song
That's fair
'Cause we never really got along
It's not new , not diverse
It won't light up your parade
It's just simple verse
All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
All this music will fade
Just like the edge of a blade
All this music will fade
What's yours is yours , and what's mine is mine
What's mine is yours , and what's yours is mine
What's mine is yours , and what's yours is mine

Yours is yours , and what's mine is mine
And what's mine is mine , and what's mine is yours
Who gives a fuck?
How dare you wear robes and reside
How dare you cover your head to hide
Your face from God
How dare you smile from behind your beard
To hide the fact that your hearts are feared
And wave your rod
How dare you be the one to assess
Me in this godforsaken mess
You , a man in a purple dress
A man in a purple dress
When you place your frown
Between my God and prayer
However grand your crown
Or dignified your hair
Men above men all prats
In your high hats
You priest , you mullah so high
You pope , you wise rabbi
You're invisible to me
Like vapor from the sea
I lovingly mock you noble lords
We all dress up to grand awards
I do that as well
I dare condemn your fashion sense
At least you're not astride the fence
That wouldn't sell
But I will deliver this address :
Your soul's condition don't impress
You , a man in a purple dress
A man in a purple dress
You talk about your crazy affairs
You talk about your life as though it really mattered
You get attention 'cos you block the stairs
Bragging about some bottles you have shattered
Well I met a man who really lives
He really does it all
But what really matters is the heart he gives
He makes your talk seem small
When a man is a man
He doesn't act to a plan
He don't have to perform like John Wayne in some B feature flick
A man is a man
When he can offer his hand
Not afraid of appearing insane if he can't break a brick
I know a man who's a man
Can't you sometimes crack a smile
Do you think if you did we would run and tell
I know one day your big villain style
Will collapse as they turn the key in the door of your cell
I know a man who was once like you
But he opened his heart
No one is really bad right through
He's just another part
When a man is a man
And he drinks 'til he's canned
He can drop to the floor , he can weep , we won't ask the price
A man is a man
He can fall he can stand
We won't love him more if he keeps his soul on the ice
I know a man who's a man
Every one of us is looking for fame
He's a looker
He's a dresser
He's a genius under pressure
I know a man who could tighten your rein
He's a father
He's a brother
He's a rocker
He's a lover
He's a man he's a man
He doesn't act to a plan
He don't have to get hitched to a train in some muscle beach trick
A man is a man
When he can offer his hand
Not afraid of appearing insane if he can't break a brick
Be a man who's a man
Deaf , dumb and blind boy
He's in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems
His musical dreams
Ain't quite so bad
Ten years old
With thoughts as bold
As thoughts can be
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know
A vague haze of delirium
Creeps up on me
All at once a tall stranger
I suddenly see
He's dressed in a silver-sparked
Glittering gown
And his golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground
Nothing to say , and nothing to hear
And nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note
In my symphony
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know
His eyes are the eyes
That transmit all they know
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey together you'll ride
Deaf , dumb and blind boy
He's in a quiet vibration land
Strange as it seems
His musical dreams
Ain't quite so bad
Ten years old
With thoughts as bold
As thought can be
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity
Sickness can surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go

Deaf Dumb and blind boy

Ten years old
With thoughts as bold as thought can be
Loving life and becoming wise
In simplicity
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know
A vague haze of delerium
Creeps up on me
All at once a tall stranger I suddenly see
He's dressed in a silver sparked
Glittering gown
And His golden beard flows
Nearly down to the ground
Nothing to say and nothing to hear
And nothing to see
Each sensation makes a note in my symphony
Sickness will surely take the mind
Where minds can't usually go
Come on the amazing journey
And learn all you should know
His eyes are the eyes that
Transmit all they know
Sparkle warm crystalline glances to show
That he is your leader
And he is your guide
On the amazing journey together you'll ride
You cannot always get it
When you really want it
You cannot always get it at all
Just because there's space
In your life it is a waste
To spend your time why don't you wait for the call
Just got to get used to it
We all get it in the end
Just got to get used to it
We go down and we come up again
Just got to get used to it
You irritate me my friend
This is no social crisis
This is you having fun
No crisis
Getting burned by the sun
This is true
This is no social crisis
Just another tricky day for you
You can always get higher
Just because you aspire
You could expire even knowing
Do not push the hands
Just hang on to the band
You can dance while your knowledge is growing
It could happen anytime
You cannot expect to never cry
Patience is priceless
Not when you try to fly so high
Just stay on that line
Rock and roll will never die
This is no social crisis
Another tricky day
Another gently nagging pain
What the papers say
Just seems to bring down heavier rain
The world seems in a spiral
Life seems such a worthless title
But break out and start a fire you all
It's all here on the vinyl
No crisis
Just got to get used to it
Got to get used to waiting
Just got to get used to it
You know how the ice is
Just got to get used to it
It is thin where you are skating
This is no social crisis
Just another tricky day for you fella
Anytime anytime anytime anytime you want me
Come on back , come on home
Ran away and left me alone in this empty place
Anywhere I go , whoa whoa , all I see is your sweet face
Though my pain keeps on growing
There's one thing , baby , you should be knowing ...
Anytime you want me come on back
Anytime you want me come on back
Anytime you want me come on back , whoa yeah
Tried to make you happy the very best I could
Anything you wanted , whoa whoa , just like a good man should
Even though you did me wrong
I'll be waiting no matter how long ...
Anytime you want me I'll be here
Anytime you want me I promise I'll be here , baby
Anytime you want me I'll be by your side , whoa yeah
Said I'll forgive you for everything in the past
All I need is one more chance , I know , I know it will last
Now you heard my story , know just what's on my mind
Tired of being lonely , whoa whoa , I've had my share of crying
Without you I can't go on
I'll be waiting no matter how long ...
Anytime you want me anytime you want me
Anytime you want me anytime you need me
Anytime you want me anytime you want me now
Oh oh oh , anytime you want me

I can't believe it
Do my eyes deceive me ?
Am I back in your arms ?
Away from all harm ?
It's like a dream to be with you again
Can't believe that I'm with you again
I missed you and I must admit
I kissed a few and once did sit
On Ivor the Engine Driver's lap
And later with him , had a nap
You are forgiven , you are forgiven , you are forgiven ... ad lib
You are forgiven
If you're troubled and you can't relax
Close your eyes and think on this
If the rumors floating in your head all turn to facts
Close your eyes and think on this
Armenia , city in the sky
Armenia , city in the sky
If you ever want to lose some time
Just take off , there's no risk
If you ever want to disappear
Just take off , and think of this
Armenia , city in the sky
Armenia , city in the sky
The sky is glass , the sea is brown
And everyone is upside-down
Armenia , city in the sky
Armenia , city in the sky
Freak out freak out!
Who

Athena , I had no idea how much I would need her
In peaceful times I hold her close and I feed her
My heart starts palpitating when I think my guess was wrong
But I think I will get along
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Athena , all I ever want to do is please her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I think I'll get along
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Just a girl , just a girl
She's just a girl
Athena , my heart felt like a shattered glass in an acid bath
I felt like one of those flattened ants you find on a crazy path
I would of topped myself to give her time she did not need to ask
Was I a suicidal psychopath ?
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
Consumed , there was a beautiful white horse I saw on a dream stage
He had a snake the size of a sewer pipe living in his rib cage
I felt like a pickled priest who was being flambed
You got me requisitioned Blondie
She's just a girl – she's a bomb
I'm happy , I'm ecstatic
Just a girl , just a girl
She's just a girl
Look into the face of a child
Measure how long you smiled
Before the memory claimed
How long would children remain
How long could children remain
Athena , you picked me up by my lapels and screamed leave her
It felt like waking up in heaven on an empty meter
And now you are stuck with a castrated leader
And I hate the creep , I didn't mean that
She's a bomb
I just said it
She is a bomb
I didn't mean it , please
She's a bomb
Athena , I had no idea how much I need her
My life has been so settled and she is the reason
Just one word from her and my troubles are long gone
But I get along
She's just a girl , she's a bomb
Out here in the fields , I fight for my meals
I get my back into my living
I don't need to fight to prove I'm right
I don't need to be forgiven , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah
Don't cry , don't raise your eye
It's only teenage wasteland
Sally , take my hand , we'll travel south 'cross land

Designed to cause men pain
Whoa , when you light up in Cuba
You won't feel the same again
Down in Guantanamo
Whew , still waiting for the big cigars

Still guilty with no charge
There’s smoke in the forest
And the tumour is getting large
Down in Guantanamo
We still got the ball and chain
Down in Guantanamo
We still got the ball and chain
There's a long road to travel
For justice to make its claim
So let's bring down the gavel
Let the prisoner say his name
Mmm , still waiting for the big cigars
Still waiting
Still waiting for the big cigars
Hey , still waiting for the big cigars

Don't you ever say never
It don't mean a thing
Going to get us together
Like beads on one string
There is always someone to blame
You don't have to look far
Now the world is aflame
And God's in the stars
I don't care how you name Him
He is always the same
I just know that we shame Him
When we kill in His name
This can't go on forever
This war in a ring
Gotta bring us together
Like beads on one string
Don't you ever say never
Don't you ever say never
'Cause it don't mean a thing
It don't mean a thing
Going to get us together
Gonna get us together
Like beads on one string
Like beads on one string
Every one of us perfect
Like beads on one string
But we all have a flaw
Like beads on one string
Then we look for the defects and we go off to war
Like beads on one string
And we send all our children
Like beads on one string
Again and again
Like beads on one string
It's our fear that will fill them
Like beads on one string
But we're really the same
This can't go on forever
This war in a ring
Gotta bring us together
Like beads on one string
Don't you ever say never
Don't you ever say never
'Cause it don't mean a thing
It don't mean a thing
Going to get us together
Gonna get us together
Like beads on one string

Don't you ever say never
Like beads on one string
Say never
Like beads on one string
Got no better thing
Like beads on one string
Gotta get us together
Like beads on one string
Like beads on one string
Oh yeah
Like beads on one string
Like beads on one string
Like beads on one string
Like beads on one string
No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man , to be the sad man
Behind blue eyes
No one knows what it's like
To be hated , to be fated
To telling only lies
But my dreams , they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours , only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free
No one knows what it's like
To feel these feelings like I do
And I blame you
No one bites back as hard
On their anger , none of my pain and woe
Can show through
But my dreams , they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours , only lonely
My love is vengeance that's never free
When my fist clenches , crack it open
Before I use it and lose my cool
When I smile , tell me some bad news
Before I laugh and act like a fool
And if I swallow anything evil
Put your finger down my throat
And if I shiver , please give me a blanket
Keep me warm , let me wear your coat
No one knows what it's like
To be the bad man , to be the sad man

Behind blue eyes
The beach is a place where a man can feel
He's the only soul in the world that's real
But I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
Hazy days
Crazy days
Aren't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred Faces
I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in '
I've got a good job and I'm newly born
You should see me dressed up in my uniform
I work in hotel all gilt and flash
Remember the gaff where the doors were smashed ?
Bell Boy !
I got to get running now
Bell Boy !
Keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy !
Carry this baggage out
Bell Boy !
Always running at someone's bleeding heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someone's heel
Some nights I still sleep on the beach
Remember when stars were in reach
Then I wander in early to work
Spend my day licking boots for my perks
The beach is a place where a man can feel
He's the only soul in the world that's real
But I see a face coming through the haze
I remember him from those crazy days
Crazy days , crazy days
Crazy days , crazy days
Aren't you the guy who used to set the paces
Riding up in front of a hundred Faces
I don't suppose you would remember me
But I used to follow you back in '
People often change
But when I look in your eyes
You could learn a lot
From a life like mine
The secret to me
It ain't flown like a flag
I carry it behind this bleeding little badge
What says
Bell Boy !
I got to get running now
Bell Boy !
Keep my lip buttoned down
Bell Boy !
Carry the bloody baggage out
Bell Boy !
Always running at someone's heel
You know how I feel
Always running at someone's heel

Frank :
I'm your friendly green coat
And I welcome you to Bernie's Holiday Camp
One day and you'll be happy
It's Bernie you will thank
You must be little Tommy
Well call me Uncle Frank
Welcome you too , Mrs . Walker Tommy : Didn't know I had an Uncle Frank; I've never met him , have I?
Here you'll always find a helping hand Tommy : Look there , Mum , a cage of budgies ! Swimming pool and donkey rides , all free!
The camp with the extras
I'm in chalet number eleven
Tommy : It's all free , Mum! When you come to Bernie's
You might think you're in heaven
Here we have the winner , folks
Have you ever seen a lovelier pair ?
What a shapely ankle
What a perfect shin
If you could feel this silken thigh
You'd know who has to win
If you could feel this silken thigh
You'd know ...
Nora :
You don't know how much I've missed
To feel a man again to dance , to kiss
Frank :
Your eyes reveal you're lonely
Nora :
This evening must pass slowly
Until we're one my heart won't rest
Will Tommy share our happiness ?
Frank :
Of course he will I'll make him smile Nora : You don't know how much I've missed
Nora : To feel a man again to dance , to kiss I'll take him out to cinemas and fairs
Football and cricket
There'll never be a happier lad
I'll be more than an Uncle
I'll be just like a Dad
Tommy :
I will be a green coat , too
And when I'm big , I'll own a holiday camp
A camp with a difference
Always be good weather
When you come to Tommy's
The holiday's forever
Nora :
I'm glad you like your Uncle Frank
He'll surely love you , too
Just like a Dad
Tommy :
He's very nice , I think
Did he fight in the war ?
Tommy and Nora :
When he's got his greencoat on
I love him even more
You jumped out of an alley
With surprise in your black widow's eyes
I was prepared to be unprepared
Been preparing for lights
I fell right in love with you
Into a thousand parts I blew
I fell right in love with you
I was caught in a corner
He recoiled from a broken romance
Taking breath after once undead
I had a firm grip on my pants
I fell right in love with you
Through a hundred hearts you flew
I fell right in love with you
Strange that when infatuation calls
We think that we've got real love in our life
It pumps like the pressure in a station hall
As the express train thunders on by
I fell right in love with you
As the blood came blowing through
I fell right in love with you
Across the room
I saw your eyes
Black window looking back at me
You held a gun
As children cried
You touched some wires
They shattered me
I was blown into a blue
There'd been nothing I could do
I fell right in love with you
I rose up to the station
Smelt your scent by the door
You stood waiting so patient
Just one wait , then no more
I fell right in love with you
There'd been nothing I could do
I fell right in love with you
Some people seem so obsessed with the morning
Get up early just to watch the sun rise
Some people like it more when there's fire in the sky
Worship the sun when it's high
Some people go for those sultry evenings
Sipping cocktails in the blue , red and grey
But I like every minute of the day
I like every second
So long as you are on my mind
Every moment has its special charm
It's all right when you're around , rain or shine
I know a crowd who only live after midnight
Their faces always seem so pale
And then there's friends of mine who must have sunlight
They say a suntan never fails
I know a man who works the night shift
He's lucky to get a job and some pay
And I like every minute of the day
I dig every second
I can laugh in the snow and rain
I get a buzz from being cold and wet
The pleasure seems to balance out the pain
And so you see that I'm completely crazy
I even shun the south of France
The people on the hill , they say I'm lazy
But when they sleep , I sing and dance
Some people have to have the sultry evenings
Cocktails in the blue , red and grey
But I like every minute of the day
I like every minute of the day
I got a girl named Bony Moronie
She's as skinny as a stick of macaroni
I see her rock and roll with her blue jeans on
Not very fat , just skin and bones
I love her and she loves me
Boy , how happy now we can be
Makin' love underneath the apple tree
My one and only , she's my heart's desire
She's a real upsetter , she's a real live wire
Gonna get married on a night in June
Rock and roll by the light of the silvery moon
I love her and she loves me
Boy , how happy now we can be
Makin' love underneath the apple tree
Told her mama and her papa too
Just exactly what we're gonna do
We're gonna get married on a night in June
To rock and roll by the light of the silvery moon
I love her and she loves me
Boy , how happy now we can be
Makin' love underneath the apple tree
Look , he's crawling up my wall
Black and hairy , very small
Now he's up above my head
Hanging by a little thread
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
Now he's dropped on to the floor
Heading for the bedroom door
Maybe he's as scared as me
Where's he gone now , I can't see
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
Creepy , crawly , creepy , crawly
Creepy , creepy , crawly , crawly
Creepy , creepy , crawly , crawly
Creepy , creepy , crawly , crawly
Creepy , creepy , crawly , crawly
There he is wrapped in a ball
Doesn't seem to move at all
Perhaps he's dead , I'll just make sure
Pick this book up off the floor
Boris the spider
Boris the spider
Creepy , crawly , creepy , crawly
Creepy , creepy , crawly , crawly
Creepy , creepy , crawly , crawly
Creepy , creepy , crawly , crawly
Creepy , creepy , crawly , crawly
He's come to a sticky end Crawly
Don't think he will ever mend Creepy , crawly
Never more will he crawl 'round Creepy , crawly
He's embedded in the ground Creepy , crawly
Boris the spider

I will always be the one to break the news , if it's alright
I never wanna bring you down , no
I will always be the one to speak the truth , if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown , no
We're layin' in
I'm so happy that it's raining out again
I'm so made up that we're naked in our bed
Like we were back when
Ooh , we'll hammer out
The deeper question needing sorting out
If there's an answer , we'll find it without doubt
We're a little more than friends
We fell through time and space
And chanced upon this place
And so far we've been safe
I will always be the one to break the news , if it's alright
I never wanna bring you down , no
I will always be the one to speak the truth , if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown , no
I never wanna bring you down , no
I never wanna bring you down
It's raining out
I'm so made up , we've been makin' out
Watching movies in our dressing gowns
Like we were or there about
What matters most ?
Life's amazing but it's been a bumpy road
No more than lately , things have been a little wild
Am I an adult or a child ?
Don't feel any different now
We watch the world go by
And so far we've been fine
I will always be the one to break the news , if it's alright
I never wanna bring you down , no
I will always be the one to speak the truth , if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown , no
I never wanna bring you down
We fell through time and space
We chanced upon this place
And so far , we've been safe
I will always be the one to break the news , if it's alright
I never wanna bring you down
I will always be the one to speak the truth , if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown , no
I never wanna bring you down
I will always be the one to break the news , if it's alright
I never wanna bring you down , no
I will always be the one to speak the truth , if it don't hurt
I never wanna see you frown
Never wanna see you down
Never wanna see you down , no

Found her in a barn in Tennessee
I paid five bucks for my Bucket T
Took me three years of sweat and blood
To clean off all of that Tennessee mud
My Bucket T Bucket T
Bucket T Bucket T
My Bucket T Bucket T
T T T Bucket bucket bucket
Bucket bucket T T , bucket T bucket T
Cruise down the street in front of school
I wanna rev it up but I gotta be cool
Driving down the road I'll get my kicks
I'll pop in the clutch and slip in the sticks
I was right , too , she's first in her class
There's nothing on the freeway she don't pass
All the girls want to take a ride with me
But there's only one seat in my Bucket T
Did you ever sleep in a bear pit
With apple cores and mice along
Did you ever lay on ice and grit
Or search for a place where the wind was gone
Did you ever tramp up endless hills
Past cozy homes with secret beds
Did you ever dream of a suicide pill
And wake up cold to the smell of bread
Well I have slept there badly twice
And shared my straw with scratching mice
Although you will find some deep brown hair
I will tell you something for nothing
There is no bears in there cache cache
Not a single bear in there cache cache
Did you ever have to make a draw
For a hard wooden bench or a bed of stone
Did you ever jimmy a stable door
Or scare the horse to escape the snow
Did you ever invade a neat little yard
Wake up the children who hope for ghosts
Did you ever cause their dogs to bark
Their guests to curse their noisy hosts
Do not jump in expecting fun
Do not swagger in there with your elephant gun
Do not enter the cage with waving chairs
Cos I will tell you something for nothing
There is no bears in there cache cache
Not a single bear in there cache cache
Did you ever pass the police at work
And hope that they might take you in
Did you ever wonder why music hurts
When someone plays it aloof to sin
Did you ever believe that a smile could cure
A happy face keep you warm at night ?
Were you ever fooled by laughter’s lure
Only to find that they laughed in spite ?
Did you ever finally find a place
A soft warm bed in a room of flowers
And when you finally laid down your face
You found you slept for a hundred hours
A hundred hours
There is no bears in there cache cache
See that girl who's smiling so brightly
Well I reckon she's cool and I reckon rightly
She's good looking and I ain't frightened
I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning
Hey little girl who's dancing so lightly
My XKE is shining so brightly
The noose around us is slowly tightening
I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning
Hey little girl who's dancing so lightly
My XKE is shining so brightly
The noose around us is slowly tightening
I'm gonna show you why they call me lightning
You can't catch me , I'm as fast as can be
Call me lightning , I'm as fast as can be
No you can't catch me , no you can't catch me
I'm a million ages past you
A million years behind you too
A thousand miles up in the air
A trillion times I've seen you there
Your hair is golden , mine is grey
You walk on grass , it turns to hay
Your blood is blue and your eyes are red
My body strains , but the nerves are dead
I can't reach you
I've strained my eyes
I can't reach you
I've split my sides
I can't reach
Tryin' to get on you
See , feel or hear from you
The distances grow greater now
You drink champagne and past me plow
You fly your plane right over my head
You're so alive and I'm nearly dead
I can't reach you
With arms outstretched
I can't reach you
I crane my neck
I can't reach
Tryin' to get on you
See , feel or hear from you
Once I caught a glimpse
Of your unguarded , untouched heart
Our fingertips touched and then
My mind tore us apart
I can't reach you
With arms outstretched
I can't reach you
I crane my neck
I can't reach
Tryin' to get on you
See , feel or hear from you
NORA : Today it rained champagne
A son was born again
A genius unchained
A life of wealth and fame , wealth and fame !
Champagne flowing down just like rain
Caviar breakfasts every day
Merchant banks and yachts at Cannes
Servants and cars and private sand !
TOMMY : See me , feel me , touch me , heal me
See me , feel me , touch me , heal me , heal me ...
NORA : They flock in thousands strong
We'll just play along
A million in reserve
For love , a just deserve , just deserve !
Francs and dollars and peacock's wings
Sequined gowns and birds that sing
Private planes and fishing lakes
Bigger crowds and bigger , bigger , bigger takes !
But what's it all worth ?
What's it all worth when my son is blind ?
He can't hear the music
Nor enjoy what I'm buying
His life is worthless
Affecting mine
I'd pay any price
To drive his plight from my mind !
TOMMY : See me , feel me , touch me , heal me
See me , feel me , touch me , heal me...
Did you ever see the faces of the children ? They get so excited
Waking up on Christmas morning hours before the winter sun's ignited
They believe in dreams and all they mean including heaven's generosity
Peeping round the door to see what parcels are for free in curiosity
And Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave ?
Surrounded by his friends he sits so silently and unaware of anything
Playing poxy pinball picks his nose and smiles and pokes his tongue at everything
I believe in love but how can men who've never seen light be enlightened ?
Only if he's cured will his spirit's future level ever heighten
And Tommy doesn't know what day it is
He doesn't know who Jesus was or what praying is
How can he be saved
From the eternal grave ?
Tommy can you hear me ?
Tommy can you hear me ?

Gypsy :
If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl will put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night
I'm the Gypsy - the acid Queen
Pay before we start
I'm the Gypsy - The acid queen
I'll tear your soul apart
Give us a room and close the door
Leave us for a while
Your boy won't be a boy no more
Young , but not a child
I'm the Gypsy - the acid queen
Pay before we start
I'm the Gypsy the acid queen
I'll tear your soul apart
Gather your wits and hold on fast
Your mind must learn to roam
Just as the Gypsy Queen must do
You're gonna hit the road
My work is done now look at him
He's never been more alive
His head it shakes his fingers clutch
Watch his body writhe
I'm the Gypsy - the acid queen
Pay before we start
I'm the Gypsy - I'm guaranteed
To break your little heart

Circles , my head is going round in circles
My mind is caught up in a whirlpool
Dragging me down
Time will tell if I'll take the homeward track
Dizziness will make my feet walk back
Walk right back to you
Everything I do , I think of you
No matter how I try , I can't get by
These circles , leading me back to you
Round and around and around and around and around
And around and around and around and around
And round and round like a fool I go
Down and down in the pool I go
Dragging me down
Everything I do , I think of you
No matter how I try , I can't get by
These circles , leading me back to you
There one thing could kill the pain of losing you
But it gets me so dizzy then I'm walking right back again
Back to you
Time will tell if these dreams are nearly fact
Don't know why I left , I'm coming back
Coming on back to you
Coke after coke after coke after coca-cola
Coke after coke after coke after coca-cola
Coke after coke after coke after coca-cola
Coke after coke after coke after coca-cola

The song goes on
I will sing again until the music enervates
The song goes on
The sting of pain will dull and finally fade away
The song goes on
Through centuries of history it reverberates
The song goes on
On curving comets track the music makes it way
This song is so long
It ends up where it begins
People are lonely

So do not let them run too far from home
You will be alone for sure on that you can depend

Tighten up the knot that will help this bloodshed end

We're on our own , cousin
All alone , cousin
Let's think of a game to play
Now the grownups have all gone away
You won't be much fun
Being blind , deaf , and dumb
But I've no one to play with today
Do you know how to play hide-and-seek ?
To find me it would take you a week
But tied to that chair you won't go anywhere
There's a lot I can do with a freak
How would you feel if I turned on the bath
Ducked your head under and started to laugh
What would you do if I shut you outside
To stand in the rain and catch cold so you die ?
I'm the school bully
The classroom cheat
The nastiest play-friend
You ever could meet
I'll stick pins in your fingers
And tread on your feet
We're on our own , cousin
All alone , cousin

To find me it would take you a week
But tied to that chair you won't go anywhere
There's a lot I can do to the freak
Maybe a cigarette burn on your arm
Would change your expression to one of alarm
Drag you around by a lock of your hair
Or give you a push at the top of the stairs
I'm the school bully
The classroom cheat
The nastiest play-friend
You ever could meet
I'll put glass in your dinner
And spikes in your seat
We're on our own , cousin

I got up this morning and did fifty-five press-ups , dad
I brushed my teeth since breakfast and I threw away my Playboy , that's bad !
The Ferrari's in the garage and I gave it a wash just for you
But please don't make me come to the theatre it's so uncool
I'll babysit my cousin and I promise not to tease him , oh no
I'll caress his little haircut and do everything to please him , oh
I'll watch him like a hawker and in case a fit should seize him
But please don't make me come to the theatre , it's so grim
Kevin's a model child
Always as good as gold
Kevin is never wild
Always does as he's told
Once it was just innocence
Brash ideas and insolence
But you will never get away
With the things you say today
But you can cry if you want
Don't you get embarrassed when you read the precious things you said
Many many years ago when life appeared a rosy red
No one ever shared your bed
Nothing ever filled your head
Except yourself and little Ted
And scary dreams that you were dead
Don't you want to hide your face
When going through your teenage books
And read the kind of crap you wrote
About Ban the Bomb and city crooks
Think about how long it took
To get over that sudden Yuk
When in the mirror you would look
Well now my son you are well in stook
Cry if you want
Didn't you wrath in anger when you saw the man in his big car
Didn't you drive a banger and a gallon didn't get you far
Should have been a famous star
But that ain't what you really are
You could shout your last hurrah
While they are propping up the bar
Maybe things were better then
Before you led a promised life
Rash commitments and heavy raps and left wing spiel all compromised
You fall in love with other's wives
Drive 'em nuts with empty lies
Angry 'cause you lost the prize
Forgot the color of their eyes
Cry if you want
Let your tears flow
Let your past go
Don't you get embarrassed when you think about the way you were
Yesterday the day before when you were young with much to learn
Aren't you glad it's your last term
No more acting lowly worm
You can make the suckers squirm
When you tell them how much you earn
Don't you feel ashamed at all the bitterness you feel inside
Does your ego save your face I had a go - I really tried
Now you know your leaders lied
Does it stop you acting snide
Or are you still a boy that cried
Tears now surely long since dried
Why should I care
If I have to cut my hair ?
I got to move with the fashion
Or be outcast
I know I should fight
But my old man he's really alright
And I'm still living at home
Even though it won't last
Zoot suit , white jacket with side vents
Five inches long
I'm out on the street again
And I'm leaping along
Dressed right for a beach fight
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling
Is still here in my brain
The kids at school
Have parents that seem so cool
And though I don't want to hurt them
Mine want me their way
I clean my room and my shoes
But my mother found a box of blues
And there doesn't seem much hope
They'll
Let me stay
Zoot suit , white jacket with side vents
Five inches long
I'm out on the street again
And I'm leaping along
Dressed right for a beach fight
But I just can't explain
Why that uncertain feeling
Is still here in my brain
Why do I have to be different to them
Just to earn the respect of a dance hall friend
Have the same old row again and again
Why do I have to move with a crowd
Of kids that hardly notice I'm around
I work myself to death just to fit in
I'm coming down
Got home on the very first train from town
My dad just left for work
He wasn't talking
It's all a game
And inside I'm just the same
My fried egg makes me sick
First thing in the morning
Girl you think you've had loving
Girl you think you've had fun
Girl you ain't a seen nothin' 'til I come along
I'm a daddy , I'm a daddy , I'm a daddy
Yeah I'm a daddy daddy I'm daddy rolling stone
I got a friend named Cody
He's got a girl named Chris
I'm gonna steal that girl though he's twice my size
'Cause I know how to do it like this
I'm a daddy , I'm a daddy , I'm a daddy
Yeah I'm a daddy daddy I'm daddy rolling stone
I'm daddy rolling stone , I'm daddy rolling stone
Daddy rolling stone , call me daddy rolling stone
I said I got a friend named Cody
He's got a girl named Chris
I'm gonna steal that girl though he's twice my size
'Cause I know how to do it like this
I'm a daddy , I'm a daddy , I'm a daddy , daddy
I'm daddy rolling stone , I'm daddy rolling stone
Just call me daddy rolling stone dear
Long hair long nose , daddy rolling stone
This could be suffering
This could be pleasure
I am unaware of any difference
My head is aging
My balls are aching
But I am not looking for deliverance
This could be letting on
This could be highly cut
I am unaware of any difference
One says it cannot be done
Then somebody does it - but
I am not watching for equivalents
I just do not quite know how to wear my hair no more
No sooner cut it than they cut it even more
Got to admit that I created private worlds
Cold sex and booze do not impress my little girls
Daily records
Just want to be making daily records
Try to avoid the bad news in the letters
Just want to be making records
Play in - play out - fade in - fade out
Making records day in - day out
And they say it is just a stage in life
But I know by now the problem is a stage
And they say just take your time and it will go away
But I know by now I am never going to change
I could be losing you
I could be coming through
I am unaware of any difference
You still support me now
You love me anyhow
And I am still under your influence
We had some years of hate
And now we're in the eights
I'm unaware of any difference
I need you even more
My money keeps me poor
I am still amazed at your omnipotence
I look at baggy suits and leather capped with puke
I look at Richmond married couples denim look
I watch my kids grow up and ridicule the bunch
When you are eleven the whole world's out to lunch
Daily records
Just want to keep making daily records
Cannot exist no more in chains and fetters
Just want to keep making records
Play in - play out - fade in - fade out
Making records day in - day out
Just want to be making daily records
Calling out around the world
Are you ready for a brand new beat
Summer's here and the time is right
For dancing in the streets
They're dancing in Chicago
Down in New Orleans
In New York City
All we need is music , sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
They'll be swinging , swaying , records playing
Dancing in the street , oh
It doesn't matter what you wear , just as long as you are there
So come on , every guy , grab a girl , everywhere , around the world
They'll be dancing , dancing in the street
It's an invitation across the nation , a chance for folks to meet
They'll be laughing and singing , music swinging
Dancing in the street
Philadelphia , PA
Baltimore in DC now
Don't forget the motor city
On the streets of Brazil
Back in the USSR
No matter where you are
All we need is music , sweet music
There'll be music everywhere
They'll be swinging , swaying , records playing
Dancing in the street , oh
It doesn't matter what you wear
Just as long as you are there
So come on every guy , grab a girl , everywhere , around the world
They'll be dancing , dancing in the streets
Way down in L.A . , everyday
Dancing in the streets
Cross in China too
Me and you
Dancing in the street
Don't you know
They'll be dancing
Dancing in the street repeat
Can you feel it ? Watching you in the darkness
Touching you like a sickness
Fear is taking control
The beach head is the street
In the gutter lies defeat
Fear is the key to your soul
That makes you dangerous
So dangerous to yourself
Can you feel it in the shadows ?
Watching you , touching you
Can you feel it in the shadows ?
Watching you , touching you
Changing you into a mad dog
Howling at the moon
And you are so far out of tune
Better learn how to sing
Fences , we put up defenses
Then we come to our senses
It may keep them out
But it keeps us in
And that makes us dangerous
We're all dangerous to ourselves
This is a jungle , not illusion
Jungle city , in confusion
We are the next step in evolution
The new stone age , revolution
Back to the stone age , constitution
No solution
Can you feel it in the shadows ?
Watching you , touching you
Can you feel it as the shadows
Follow you , swallow you ?
Can you feel it ?
Fear is the key
Can you feel it ?
Fear is the key
Can you feel it ? Can you feel it ?
Fear is the key to your soul
Danny laid back and surveyed the view
A king on his bench , he was cold , he was blue
I asked for permission to give him a note
He nodded , not movin' , just scratched at his throat
Always smiled slightly , seemed so bemused
Like he was the one , who was glad to be used
I had a sense he was playin' a part
But I had to help , for he tore at my heart
He would walk , his feet wrapped in rags
He wandered the neighborhood , carrying his bags
The pride in his eyes would so clearly flash
Like I was the one who needed the cash
The tramps in our England , have always to walk
From billet to dosshouse , a fifteen mile stalk
The tramps in our country have no wares to hawk
Only spirits give comfort , there's no time to talk
Danny would lay , he'd never speak
Here was a man who had attained his peak
No fables to tell , and nothing held back
This was a man who had led a strong pack
Old soldier , perhaps , or a worn old jailbird
Who'd never an inkling and never a word
At two hundred down , my project had fled
Danny was gone or may well have been dead
He walked slowly , no hurryin' to death
Took in turn his view with his very last breath
The river , the mist and the slightly grey sky
Danny was waiting , patient to die
The tramps in our England , have always to walk
From billet to dosshouse , a fifteen mile stalk
The tramps in our country have no wares to hawk
Only spirits give comfort , there's no time to talk
Danny laid back , looked down at the plain
The king on his bench with magnificent mane
I asked his permission to give him a note
He nodded , not movin' , just scratched at his throat
It's dangerous to patronize those who live rough
Danny was a giant , solid and tough
He allowed me to gift him and scribble this song
Without me and my ponies , he'd live just as long
Detour , detour
Ooh , we got to make a detour
Detour , detour
The people try , but crash right down
Shoot at the sky , a craze with rage
We're all good people if you go deep down
But we gotta be in keeping with the brand new age
Time for a detour
We oughta take the curve Detour now
Taking the detour
Ooh it's time for a swerve Detour now
The world's in a spin now
It's time for a change
We know we can win now
We'll share the wage , we cause no pain
We can explain , we lost the force , we went off course
Ooh , we need a detour Detour
Detour
With a curve and a swerve Detour
Mmm , detour Detour
Forget that flaw from back in the days
And the power we sought as we took the stage
Made it years till we found our ways
Our direction veers as we turn the page
Gotta take a detour
The road is blocked Detour now
Time for a detour
Ooh , the gates are locked Detour now
We're finally tracking in the path of the groove
We're willingly backing the path of the moon
There'll be no more pain
We can explain , we found the force , we're back on course
We need a detour Detour
Gotta make the detour Detour
Oh , with a curve and a swerve Detour
Detour
Used to say I love you but I was straight insane
I always left you holding the weight of my pain
'Cause I couldn't stay for even one more day
I broke two hearts , I couldn't share the parts
Then I ran away
People try to crash right down
Shoot at the sky , a craze with rage
We're all good people if you go deep down
But we gotta be in keeping with the brand new age
Time for a detour
We gotta take the curve Detour now
Making the detour
It's time for a swerve Detour now
The world is spinnin'
It's time for a change
We know we ain't winning
We share the wage
We cause no pain , we can explain
We lost the force , we went off course
Ooh , we need a detour Detour
Oh , I got to have a detour Detour
Oh , with a curve and a swerve Detour
Ooh , we need a detour Detour
Detour Take a curve and a swerve
Detour
Detour
We need a detour Detour)
I wake up on broken glass
But you left your number
All the members of the cast
Reckon I was lumbered
Did you steal it
Did you screw me
Did you peel it
Did you do me
Are you out there Mr no-one
Is my investment growing
Sorry that I got so drunk
But I wrote you a poem
Did you search me
Did you turn me over
While I cold turkey
On the sofa
Did you steal my money
How can we forgive a grievance
Now that we all live with demons
Did you know that poor old veteran
That you kicked out of his bed
Says that he cannot forget you
But he does not wish you dead
Leave his gold watch in reception
He will keep the sixteen stitches in his head
Did you steal his money
Did you pinch my trainer football
Say if you half inched it
Thought I heard a female foot fall
While I washed my kitchen
Did you use me
Why would I trust you
Why would you abuse me
I will not bust you
Did you steal my lorry
It fell right off my lorry
Did you pinch my brass
Nick my gilt you asshole
We old ones , have seen two wars
When you're sick and afraid
And there's danger around
Take a pick and a spade
And Cut into the ground
Away from the light
Away from the sound
Make a trap for the beast
Dig his burial mound
Dig for your life
Dig to the death
Dig for Salvation
Till your very last breath
Dig for protection
Dig for release
Dig for resurrection
Dig for peace
We old ones , have seen two wars
When you dream of a laser
That sears your soul
Slices like a razor
Burns like coal
You can bet you'll forget
When the rock starts to roll
And the last meets the least
By the watering hole
Dig it down deep
Dig it out wide
Dig it pleasure
Dig it for pride
Dig it for treasure
Dig it for stones
Dig it for the metal
And dig it for the bones
We old ones , have seen two wars

I used to know everything about you
But today when I tried to point you out to one of my friends
I picked the wrong girl again
Don't see you in the crowd anymore
I think it's you but I can't be sure
You're wearing disguises
Occasionally a girl surprises me
When she turns out to be you
Wearing disguises
I don't think you want me to see you ever again
And today I saw you dressed as a flower bed
Last week you had a wig on your head
Directing traffic in the street
And your shoes were too big for your feet
You were wearing disguises
Occasionally a girl surprises me
When she turns out to be you
Wearing disguises
Wearing disguises
Doctor , there's something wrong with me
My health is not all that it used to be
My heart is out of beat , I got chokers on my feet
My eyesight's getting dimmer , I can't see
Doctor thanks for seeing me today , I'm glad
I've got every sickness there is to be had
I had whooping cough last month
And today I've got the mumps
And tomorrow I'll catch chicken pox as well
Doctor doctor doctor make me well
I've not got long to go now I can tell
Doctor doctor doctor make me well
I've not got long to go I can tell
Those pills I took have no effect at all
Just the other day I had a nasty fall
And I think I broke my jaw when it hit the kitchen floor
And I'm shrinking last week I was five foot four
I've been getting shivers lately , is it flu ?
I know the bug is going round , what can I do ?
It's about to pick on me , I've still got the other three
Do you think I caught smallpox I'd get flu ?
Do you think it's time that I made out my will ?
I'll leave everything to you to pay my bill
Just how long is there to go
Please tell me I want to know
But on second thoughts don't tell me , I'm too ill
Laugh and say I'm green
I've seen things you've never seen
Talk behind my back
I'm off the beaten track
I'll take on anyone
Ain't scared of a bloody nose
Drink till I drop down
With one eye on my clothes
What is it ?
I'll take it
Who is she ?
I'll rape it
Got a bet there ?
I'll meet it
Getting high
You can't beat it
Doctor Jimmy and Mister Jim
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin
You say she's a virgin
But I'm gonna be the first in
Her fella's going to kill me ?
Oh , fucking will he
I'm seeing d-double
Don't miss me if you can
There's gonna be trouble
When she chooses her man
What is it ?
I'll take it
Who is she ?
I'll rape it
Got a bet there ?
I'll meet it
Getting high
You can't beat it
Doctor Jimmy and Mister Jim
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin
Is it me for a moment ?
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
Is it me for a moment ?
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
I'm going back soon
Home to get that baboon
Who cut up my eye
Tore up my Levis
I'm feeling restless
Bring another score around
Maybe something stronger
Could really hold me down
What is it ?
I'll take it
Who is she ?
I'll rape it
Got a bet there ?
I'll meet it
Getting high
You can't beat it
What is it ?
I'll take it
Who is she ?
Ooh , I'll rape it
Doctor Jimmy and Mister Jim
When I'm pilled you don't notice him
He only comes out when I drink my gin
Is it me for a moment ?
The stars are falling
The heat is rising
The past is calling
Is it me for a moment ?
The stars are falling
The heat is rising

The first time we met
You were a kennel maid
You gave me a tip
I got me forecast paid
You were holding the greyhound
In trap number one
Your white coat was shining
In the afternoon sun
Now we're both together
We're never gonna break apart , no no
'Cause we're a happy couple , you and me
With a greyhound at either knee
I'll have ten shillings to win
On Camira Flash , young man
Hey , what dog's that?
Hey , its ... it's the duke's dog , innit?
There was nothing in my life
Bigger than beer
There was nothing in my life
Bigger than beer
'Ceptin' you , little darling
'Ceptin' you , little darling
We're a happy couple , you and me
With a greyhound at either knee
We go to the dog track
On Saturday nights
We put all our money
On a dog that we like
A kiss and a cuddle
And hot meat pie
Two dollar tickets
And a starry sky
There was nothing in my life
Bigger than beer
There was nothing in my life
Bigger than beer
'Ceptin' you , little darling
'Ceptin' you , little darling
We're a happy couple , you and me
With a baby on either knee
Yes it's you , little darling
Yes it's you , little darling
Now it's you , little darling
Now it's you
Eh , where's me wage packet ?
Ah , I'll put twenty-five knicker , please
On Yellow Printer
Oh , I hope the wife don't find out
Yes , it's sure to win , isn't it ?
Yes , I know , it's a good dog
I saw it run at White City , just last week
Broke the record , Yellow Printer
Nice dog , yes , lovely form
Lovely buttocks...
I cannot be held responsible for blown behavior
I lost all contact with my only savior
No-one locked me out because I failed to phone up
I cannot bear to live forever like a loner
Do not let go the coat
It is easy to be sad : when you lack a partner
But how would I react to a broken heart now
It is not really true rock and roll unless I am
Hanging onto you and when I hold it next time
I will not let go the coat
I try to explain but you never understand it
I need your body but I cannot just demand it
I will not let go like a stray at heel
Never let it out of your sight
Every lonely wife knows the way I feel
Do not let go tonight
Do not let go the coat
Never let go the coat
Your friends all pass for life is just a market
But you have to finish everything you started
So I live my life tearing down the runway
Sure to get the hang of hanging in there someday
Do not let go the coat
Will get no more chances - forget the war dances
Go blind and hang on – do not try the slang son
Never let go the coat
Don't go and hide
Yesterday you were my girlfriend
If you do
My inside goes around and around in a whirlwind
There's a stone in my shoe
So I can't catch you up
My head's in a lion's mouth
Wants to eat me up
Right here today
Don't look away
I've always been true
And I still love you
So don't look away
There's a lot you can do
To get me away
You've got to stay
Don't look away
Don't look away
I once heard you say
If I ever was down you would help me
Now my head's being chewed up
You tried to pretend that you don't see
There's a stone in my shoe
So I can't catch you up
My head's in a lion's mouth
Wants to eat me up
Right here today
Don't look away
I've always been true
And I still love you
So don't look away
There's a lot you can do
To get me away
You've got to stay
Don't look away
Don't look away
I've always been true
And I still love you
So don't look away
There's a lot you can do
To get me away
You've got to stay
Don't look away
Don't look away
Don't look away
Don't look away
Don't look away
Do you think it's alright
To leave the boy with Uncle Ernie ?
Do you think it's alright
He's had a few too many tonight
Do you think it's alright ? I think it's alright
Do you think it's alright
To leave the boy with Cousin Kevin ?
Do you think it's alright ?
There's something 'bout him I don't really like
Do you think it's alright ?
I think it's alright
Yes , I think it's alright
Do you think it's alright
To leave the boy with Uncle Ernie ?
Do you think it's alright ?
He's had a bit too many tonight
Do you think it's alright ?
Yes , I think it's alright
Yes , I think it's alright
Do you think it's alright
Leaving Tommy by the mirror ?
You would think he had sight
Staring half the night
Do you think it's alright ?
I think it's alright
Yes , I think it's alright
Do you think it's alright
To leave the boy with Uncle Ernie ?
Do you think it's alright
He's had a few too many tonight
Do you think it's alright ? I think it's alright
I feel like I want to break out of the house
My heart is a-pumping , I've got sand in my mouth
I feel like I'm heading up to a cardiac arrest
I want to scream in the night , I want a manifest
I've got that wide awake , give-and-take , five o'clock-in-the-morning feeling
I've got the hots for the sluts in the well thumbed pages of a magazine
I want to drive , want to fly like I do in the dreams I've never really been in
I want to hump , want to jump , want to heat up and cool down in a dream machine
I'm dreaming from the waist on down
I'm dreaming but I feel tired and bound
I'm dreaming of the day that a cold shower helps my health
I'm dreaming , dreaming - of the day I can control myself
Day I can control myself
Sound like a priest and then I'm shooting dice
I'm burning tires with some guy whose hair is turning white
I know the girls that I pass , they just ain't impressed
I'm too old to give up , but too young to rest
I've got that numb-to-a-thumb over-dubbed
Feeling social when the world is sleeping
The plot starts to thicken then I sicken and I feel like I'm cemented down
I'm so juiced that the whorey lady's sad , sad story has me quietly weeping
But here comes the morning
Here comes the yawning demented clown
I'm dreaming but I know it's all hot air
I'm dreaming I'll get back to that rocking chair
I'm dreaming of a day when I can share the wealth
I'm dreaming , dreaming - of the day I can control myself
Day I can control myself
Hey , hey !
The day I can control myself
Hyde , Hyde
Someone is spending my money for me
The money I earn I never see
In all things I do he interferes
All I know is trouble as soon as he appears
Mister Hyde , Mister Hyde , Mister Hyde , Mister Hyde , Hyde
When I drink my potion my character changes
My whole mind and body rearranges
This strange transformation takes place in me
Instead of myself everybody can see
Mister Hyde , Mister Hyde , Mister Hyde , Mister Hyde , Hyde
Whenever you're with me make sure it's still me
I've got to the stage I can't tell which I'll be
The loveable fellow who'll buy you a drink
Then when he's drunk his he'll change in a wink into
Hyde , Mister Hyde , Mister Hyde , Mister Hyde , Hyde
There are men high up there fishing
Haven't seen quite enough of the world
I ain't seen a sign of my hero
And I'm still diving down for pearls
Let me flow into the ocean
Let me get back to the sea
Let me be stormy , let me be calm
Let the tide in and set me free
I'm flowing under bridges
Then flying through the sky
I'm travelling down cold metal
Just a tear in baby's eye
Let me flow into the ocean
Let me get back to the sea
Let me be stormy , let me be calm
Let the tide in and set me free
Set me free
I am not the actor
This can't be the scene
But I am in the water
As far as I can see
I'm remembering distant memories
Recalling other names
Rippling over canyons
And boiling in the train
Let me flow into the ocean
Let me get back to the sea
Let me be stormy , let me be calm
Let the tide in and set me free
Set me free
Set me free
I want to drown
In cold water
There are men high up there fishing
Haven't seen quite enough of the world
I ain't seen a sign of my hero
And I'm still diving down for pearls
Let me flow into the ocean
Let me get back to the sea
Let me be stormy , let me be calm
Let the tide in and set me free
I'm flowing under bridges
Then flying through the sky
I'm traveling down cold metal
Just a tear in baby's eye
Let me flow into the ocean
Let me get back to the sea
Let me be stormy , let me be calm
Let the tide in and set me free
I am not the actor
This can't be the scene
But I am in the water
As far as I can see
I'm remembering distant memories
Recalling other names
Rippling over canyons
And boiling in the train
Let me flow into the ocean
Let me get back to the sea
Let me be stormy , let me be calm
Let the tide in and set me free
Set me free
Set me free
I want to drown
In cold water
Three thirty-six , it's cold
I know I'm growing old
With life's best side on the downward slope
It's in my own hands , I know I'll cope
My girl's with me
And all my friends can see
Here I am again
Early morning cold taxi
Early morning cold taxi
Done it before , do it again
Know from experience it's not in vain
She's the best I've had , I cannot see
What someone else can do to me
It's a long way home
But love's so warm , you'll see
Here I am again
Early morning cold taxi
Early morning cold taxi
Early morning cold taxi
Each time I do it
I feel so down and out
Early morning cold taxi
Though my mind thinks strange
I'll keep on , no doubt
Three thirty-six , it's cold
I know I'm growing old
One day , we'll be wed
This I know , for it's what she said
Then no more
Will my mind be uneasy
Early morning cold taxi
Each time I do it
I feel so down and out
Early morning cold taxi
Though my mind thinks strange
I'll keep on , no doubt
Three thirty-six , it's cold
I know I'm growing old
One day , we'll be wed
This I know , for it's what she said

The sun shines
And people forget
The spray flies as the speedboat glides
And people forget
Forget they're hiding
The girls smile
And people forget
The snow packs as the skier tracks
And people forget
Forget they're hiding

Why was I born today
Life is useless like Ecclesiastes say
I never had a chance
But opportunity's now in my hands
I stand with my guitar
All I need's a mirror
Then I'm a star
I'm so sick of dud TV
Next time you switch on
You might see me
Oh , what a thrill for you
I've been there and gone there
I've lived there and bummed there
I've spinned there , I gave there
I drank there and I slaved there
I've had enough of the way things been done
Every man on a razors edge
Someone has used us to shoot with the same gun
Killing each other then we jump off a ledge
My life's a mess I wait for you to pass
I stand here at the bar , I hold an empty glass
Don't worry smile and dance
You just can work life out
Don't let down moods entrance you
Take the wine and shout
We found this pile of paper
Written by that ether man
He hatched a mad old caper
He had a mad old plan
He'd turn us into music
He'd show us to our portals
He gathered wire and angels
To entertain immortals
Out on the endless wire
You talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
Yeah , you talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
Every time she starts to lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind
You know her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
Her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
Every time she starts to shakin'
The dumb begin to talk
She's got the power to heal you
Never fear
She's got the power to heal you
Never fear
Just a word from her lips
And the deaf begin to hear
You talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
Yeah , you talk about your woman
I wish you could see mine
Every time she starts to lovin'
She brings eyesight to the blind
You know her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
Her daddy gave her magic
I can tell by the way she walks
Every time she starts to shakin'
The dumb begin to talk
She's got the power to heal you
Never fear
She's got the power to heal you
Never fear
Just a word from her lips
And the deaf begin to hear
We've got to face the face
You must have heard the cautionary tales
The dangers hidden on the cul-de-sac trails
From wiser men who have been through it all
And the ghosts of failures spray-canned up on the wall
We've got to judge the judge
Got to find the finds
We've got to scheme the schemes
Have to line the lines
We must stake the stakes
And show the shown
We must take the takes
And know the known
Try to place the place
Where we can face the face
Face the face-got to
Face the face
You must have tried and the defied belief
Maybe found futility in insular grief
I need your hunger just as you need mine
A million appetites can swallow up time
We've got to fool the fools
And plan the plans
We must rule the rules
Got to stand the stands
We must fight the fight
And fall the falls
We must light the light
And call the calls
We must race the race
So we can face the face
New York ! Chicago !
London and Glasgow !
Keep looking !
Keep on cooking
Keep on looking
Gotta stay on this case
Study the pix
Watch the fix
We've got to find the face
Try to place the place where we can face the face
It may be warm but the snow is going to fall
Enough to cover us all
We've gotta be strong men and follow a path again
We've got to have faith in something bigger
Faith in something bigger
Faith in something big inside ourself
It might be cold but the heat of our love will melt
The snow we never felt
We're young and hardy again , we can bow to weaker men
The more we learn , the less we believe to be true
The more we prove , the more remains to be proved
We've gotta be strong men and follow a path again
Inside ourself
Faith in something bigger
I'm your wicked Uncle Ernie
I'm glad you won't see or hear me

Fire ! I'll take you to burn
Fire ! I'm gonna take you to learn
I'll see you burn !
You fought hard and saved and earned
Now all of it's going to burn
In your mind , your tiny mind
You know you've been completely blind
Don't you dream of what you left so far behind ?
Fire ! To destroy all you've done
Fire ! To end all you've become
I'll see you burn !
You were living your life just like a little girl
Spreading your wings in the middle of your little world
And in your mind , your tiny mind
You know you've fallen far behind
Now you're gonna burn
Fire ! You're gonna burn!
Our first gig in England for a very long time ... well , it seems like a long time . Actually , it's been about a month and a half , two months . And it's really great to play in England again . This is a—
We been over with the Germans , you know , ooh , ugh ...
There was food poisoning in the sauerkraut !
They're very tough , actually . This one is a rock and roll song , done by a guy called Benny Spellman , I'm sure you've never heard of him , but I'm sure you've heard of The Rolling Stones , cos they done it—
The Merseybeats !
Ooh , yeah , The Merseybeats , they done it !
laughing And Wayne Fontana , he did it ! And now we do it , it's one called Fortune Teller.
And ours is the most important version !
I went to the fortune teller
To have my fortune read
I didn't know what to tell her
I had a dizzy feeling in my head
Said she'd take a look at my palm
Said , Sonny , you feel kind of warm
And she looked into her crystal ball
And said , You're in love
I said , It could not be so
Not with all the girls I know
She said , When the next one arrives
Take a look into her eyes
I left there in a hurry
Looking forward to my big surprise
The next thing I discovered
The fortune teller told me lies
I hurried right back to that woman
Mad as I could be
Said , I didn't see nobody
Why'd she made a fool out of me ?
At last something shook me
As if it came down from above
While looking at the fortune teller
Now I'm in love
He kicked me out
He kicked me out
He kicked me out
He kicked me out
You must've heard of them , a kind of screwed-up blend
Split personality
Two sides to fight and argue all night
Over coffee or tea
Well that's okay , I wouldn't mind , touché
Or even three , and that's no joke
But with a four-way split , the pocket money's hit
And all of me is broke
I got four heads inside my mind
Four rooms I'd like to lie in
Four selves I want to find
And I don't know which one is me
I get four papers in the box each day
Four girls ringing that I want to date
I look in the mirror and see my face
But I don't know which one is me Don't know which one is me
He kicked me out , he kicked me out
He kicked me out , he kicked me out
I wake up over here and then I'm over here
I'm trying to brush my teeth
It's little things that are hard
Like starting up the car and I'm still underneath
I get along alright , in fact it's fun at night
I get four-dimensional dreams
But I have to think before I take a drink
I get hungover times sixteen
There are four records I want to buy
Four highs I'd like to try
Every letter I get I send four replies
And I don't know which one's from me
I've got four hang-ups I'm trying to beat
Four directions and just two feet
I've got a very very secret identity
And I don't know which one is me
You think it's funny , I can tell
Well , you don't understand too well
I get so lonely and turned around
But I can't let it bring me down
I got four hang-ups I'm trying to beat
Four directions and just two feet
Got a very very secret identity
And I don't know which one is me
Are we breathing out
Or breathing in
Are we leaving life
Or moving in
Exploding out
Imploding in
Ingrained in good
Or stained in sin
Are we breathing out
Or breathing in
Are we leaving life
Or moving in
Are we breathing out
Or breathing in
Are we breathing in
We are a billion fragments
Exploding outward
Like broken glass , we damage
Even in defeat
We are tiny peices
Falling now and settling
Like snowflake crystal
Building on the city street
Snowflakes falling
Are we the parts
Are we the whole
Are we the thoughts
Are we the soul
The parts of me
And this is true
The parts of me
Belong to you
Are we the parts
Are we the whole
Are we the thoughts
Are we the soul
The parts of me
And this is true
The parts of me
The parts of you
Belong to you
And you
Are we breathing out
Or breathing in
Are we leaving life
Or moving on
Are we breathing out
Or breathing in
Are we breathing in
We are tiny pieces
Falling now and settling
Like snowflake crystal
Building on the city street
Snowflakes falling
Are we the parts
Are we the whole
Are we the thoughts
Are we the soul
The parts of me
And this is true
The parts of me
Belong to you
Breathing out
Breathing in
Breathing out
Breathing in
Breathing out
Breathin in
Belong to you
And you

I'm singing this note 'cause it fits in well with the chords I'm playing

Girl's eyes , butterflies , how she cries , can't get through to you
She knows all the charts , breaks her heart , thinks a lot of you
Each time you play a melody
It means the earth to this little girl
Can you be cruel and break her heart
Tear her small world apart ?
She's there , eyes aglow , very front row , don't throw sticks at her
Please don't look her way , see her way , don't care anyway
It's you who led her on , I see
Just leave her down in her misery
She don't want help from you and me
Can't tell a note from a symphony
It's you who led her on , I see
Just leave her down in her misery
She don't want help from you and me
Can't tell a note from a symphony
Girl's eyes , butterflies , how she cries , can't get through to you
She knows all the charts , breaks her heart , thinks a lot of you
Each time you play a melody
It means the earth to this little girl
Can you be cruel and break her heart
Tear her small world apart?
She wasn't a fool
That glittering girl
She followed the rules
That shimmering pearl
Said the rules mama preaches
Go down when they break
The things mama teaches
You just gotta shake
But she wasn't a fool
That slender love figure
She followed her rules
And made money bigger
She wasn't a fool
That shining young woman
She followed her rules
She's crying for no man
Said the rules mama teaches
Go down when they're broken
She explodes into peaches
And cries when I've spoken
She wasn't a fool
That goddess of Hell
There are no mother's rules
She makes them herself
And I was down upon my knees
To beg her surrender up to me
Something inside her
Told her she shouldn't
Tried and allied her
But the girl wouldn't
She wasn't a fool
But love flowed from her face
She's not scared of me
She's afraid of disgrace
She wasn't a fool
That female for our world
She followed her rules
That glittering girl
That glittering girl
That glittering girl
That glittering girl
Separates and lingerie
Seven pairs of shoes
Lots of Woolworth's makeup
A pair of Black Watch trews
Your out-of-tune piano
Sentimental photographs
A million little memories
A million little laughs
The wing on the aeroplane
Has just caught on fire
I say without reservation
We ain't getting no higher
All you wanted from me
All I had to give
Nothing matters , you'll see
When in paradise you live
The plane is diving faster
We're getting near the ground
Nobody is screaming
No one makes a sound
It's a girl , Mrs . Walker , it's a girl
It's a girl , Mrs . Walker , it's a girl
Mrs . Walker , it's a girl
It's a girl , Mrs . Walker , it's a girl
Mrs . Walker , it's a girl
It's a girl , Mrs . Walker , it's a girl
And when the world began
I'd been asleep forever
I opened one eye
Twas then it was I
Got the whim to wake
And when the weight of space
Rolled like it was an ocean
One became one
Father and son
Watched the sunrise break
And as the ocean warmed
And from this dream we woke
One sang to greet the dawn
One pursed his lips and spoke
Wake up and hear the music
Wake up and hear the music play
Wake up and hear the music
Wake up and hear what the people say
I heard the heavens sing
Predicting Marty Robbins
I knew I'd find
Music and time
Were the perfect plan
I watched my son sail on
A little ship a-bobbing
I had to grow
I needed to know
Exactly who I am
I'm goin' down
Down , down , down , down , down
I'm goin' down
Down , down , down , down , down
I've got my head out the window
And my bare feet on the ground
She's gone
Gone , gone , gone , gone , gone
She's gone
Gone , gone , gone , gone , gone
I've got my head out the window
And my bare feet on the ground
I'm goin' down
Down , down , down , down , down
I'm goin' down
I've got my head out the window
And my bare feet on the ground
I'm goin' home
And when I wanna go home
I'm goin' mobile
Well , I'm gonna find a home
And we'll see how it feels
Goin' mobile
Keep me movin'
I can pull up by the curb
I can make it on the road
Goin' mobile
I can stop in any street
Invite in people that we meet
Goin' mobile
Keep me movin'
Out in the woods
Or in the city
It's all the same to me
When I'm drivin' free , the world's my home
When I'm mobile
Hee , hoo
Beep beep
Play the tape machine
Make the toast and tea
When I'm mobile
Well , I can lay in bed
With only highway ahead
When I'm mobile
Keep me movin'
Keep me movin'
Over
Keep me groovin'
Just a hippie gypsy
Come on move now
Movin'
Keep me movin' , yeah
Keep me movin' , groovin' , groovin' , yeah
Movin' , yeah
Mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile , mobile
I don't care about pollution
I'm an air-conditioned gypsy
That's my solution
Watch the police and the tax man miss me
I'm mobile
Ooh , yeah , hee-hee
Mobile , mobile , mobile yeah , mm

Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
When I was a little younger
I had to justify my angst
I'd spend a lotta precious time
Tryna find the facts
Then one day , I met Mikael
Mikael don't like my whine
So now I don't look toward my death
I look toward my life
Somehow this girl changed me
From a sad man to a clown
Now they call me crazy
'Cause nothing gets me down
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
When me and my girl walk down the street
I don't stare people out
All the things I used to do like that
I do without
Everything with her makes sense
Everything is real
You don't need no evidence
When you're sayin' what you feel
Nothing , yeah
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Somehow this girl changed me
From a sad man to a clown
Now they call me crazy
'Cause nothing gets me down
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
Got nothing to prove anymore
He seems to be completely unreceptive
The tests I gave him show no sense at all
His eyes react to light the dials detect it
He hears but cannot answer to your call
See me , feel me , touch me , heal me
See me , feel me , touch me , heal me
There is no chance , no untried operation
All hope lies with him and none with me
Imagine though the shock from isolation
When he suddenly can hear and speak and see
See me , feel me , touch me , heal me
See me , feel me , touch me , heal me
His eyes can see
His ears can hear , his lips speak
All the time the needles flick and rock
No machine can give the kind of stimulation
Needed to remove his inner block
Go to the mirror boy !
Go to the mirror boy !
I often wonder what he is feeling
Has he ever heard a word I've said ?
Look at him in the mirror dreaming
What is happening in his head ?
Listening to you I get the music
Gazing at you I get the heat
Following you I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet !
Right behind you I see the millions
On you I see the glory
From you I get opinions
From you I get the story
What is happening in his head
Ooooh I wish I knew , I wish I knew
He seems to be completely unreceptive
The tests I gave him show no sense at all
His eyes react to light the dials detect it
He hears but cannot answer to your call
See me , feel me , touch me , heal me
See me , feel me , touch me , heal me
There is no chance , no untried operation
All hope lies with him and none with me
Imagine though the shock from isolation
When he suddenly can hear and speak and see
See me , feel me , touch me , heal me
See me , feel me , touch me , heal me
His eyes can see
His ears can hear , his lips speak
All the time the needles flick and rock
No machine can give the kind of stimulation
Needed to remove his inner block
Go to the mirror boy !

Each time we come here
I see we'll never come here again
Each time we make love
I say we'll never make love again
But , my little greyhound girl
You got me running , down the flat
But , my little greyhound girl
I'm in your dreams
Each time we ride out
I say we'll never ride out again
And , when we kiss
I say we'll never , never kiss again
But , my little greyhound girl
You got me running down the flat
My little greyhound girl I'm in your dreams
I'm looking for reasons
I'm looking for reasons
But there ain't a why or a where for to live around my little greyhound girl
You've got me running , down the flat
My little greyhound girl
I'm in your track
You're alone above the street somewhere
Wondering how you'll ever count out there
You can walk , you can talk , you can fight
But inside you've got something to write
In your hand you hold your only friend
Never spend your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
Your guitar or your pen
When you take up a pencil and sharpen it up
When you're kicking the fence and still nothing will budge
When the words are immobile until you sit down
Never feel they're worth keeping , they're not easily found
Then you know in some strange , unexplainable way
You must really have something
Jumping , thumping , fighting , hiding away
Important to say
When you sing through the verse and you end in a scream
And you swear and you curse cause the rhyming ain't clean
But it suddenly comes after years of delay
You pick up your guitar , you can suddenly play
When your fingers are bleeding and the knuckles are white
Then you can be sure , you can open the door
Get off of the floor tonight
You have something to write
When you want to complain , there's no one can stop you
But when your music proclaims , there's no one can top you
You are wearing your heart on your jumping feet
You've got a head start away from the street
But is that what you want , to be rich and be gone ?
Could be there's just one thing left in the end
Your guitar and your pen
When you sing to your mum , and you hum and you croon
And she says that she'd like it with more of a tune
And you smash your guitar at the end of the bed
Then you stick it together and start writing again
And you know that it won't be too long 'til you're back
To bring her some money , she's calling you honey
Stashed in a bloody great sack
In your Cadillac
Never spend your guitar or your pen
I've had enough of being nice
I've had enough of right and wrong
I've had enough of trying to love my brother
I've had enough of being good
And doin' everything like I'm told I should
If you need a lover , you'd better find another
Life is for the living
Takers never giving
Suspicion takes the place of trust
My love is turning into lust
If you get on the wrong side of me you better run for cover
I've had enough of being trodden on
My passive days are going to be long gone
If you slap one cheek , well , I ain't gonna turn the other
Life is for the living
Takers never giving
Fooling no one but ourselves
Good is dying
Here comes the end
Here comes the end of the world
I'm getting sick of this universe
Isn't going get better; it's going to get worse
And the world's going to sink with the weight of the human race
Hate and fear in every face
I'm getting ready and I've packed my case
If you find somewhere better , can you save my place ?
Fooling no one but ourselves
Good is dying
Here comes the end
Here comes the end of the world
Radio One!
Happy Jack wasn't old , but he was a man
He lived in the sand at the Isle of Man .
The kids would all sing , he would take the wrong key
So they rode on his head in their furry donkey
The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried , tried , tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied , lied , lied , lied , lied
But they couldn't stop Jack , or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy
But they couldn't stop Jack , or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from feeling happy
The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried , tried , tried
They dropped things on his back
They lied , lied , lied , lied , lied
But they couldn't stop Jack , or the waters lapping
And they couldn't prevent Jack from being happy
I saw yer!
Happy Jack had some fun here on Radio One
Yes , no bum notes , no joking.
Joke over lads.
No fucking about . Joke over , boys . Let's get down to good , serious , recording.
Let's get down to brass tacks.
Ready , steady , go.
Ah , you had that one ready , didn't you?
One-- oh , hold on.
Oh.
One , two , three...

Johnny boy , he's always propping up the bar
He's sees life crystallized through his jar
He says he only lives for beer
But deep in his heart is a cry of fear
Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a soul that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto
A heart to hang onto
Sally seems to get bigger everyday
She evens out in a contented way
A finger on the pulse of every guy
But deep in the night you can hear her cry
Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a life that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto
Oh please a heart to hang onto
Give me heart to hang onto
Give me a soul that's tailored new
Give me a heart to hang onto , ooh yeah
Give me a heart to hang onto , oo-ooh
Danny , he wants to save for a new guitar
He's going to learn to play but he won't get far
He thinks it's an easy going' high
But his whole life is just another try
Give me a heart to hang onto
Give me a suit that's tailored true
Give me a heart to hang onto
A heart to hang on ...
Oo-oh yeah
I need a heart ... to hang onto...
Heat wave
Heat wave
Whenever I'm with you
Something inside
Starts to burn deep
And my heart's filled with fire
Could be that I'm very sentimental
Or is this just the way love's supposed to be ?
I got a heat wave
Burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying
Tearing me apart
Sometimes she calls my name
Yeah , yeah , yeah , I can't explain
I feel , yeah I feel
I feel this burning flame
This high blood pressure's got a hold on me
Because this is the way love's supposed to be
I got a heat wave
Burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying
Tearing me apart
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Just give me another chance
This could be a new romance
Heat wave
Heat wave
Heat wave

On top of the sky is a place where you go
If you've done nothing wrong
If you've done nothing wrong
And down in the ground is a place where you go
If you've been a bad boy
If you've been a bad boy
In the place up above you grow feather wings
And you fly 'round and 'round
With a harp singing hymns
And down in the ground you grow horns and a tail
And you carry a fork
And moan and wail
Why can't we have eternal life
And never die
Never die ?
Heaven , Heaven , Heaven and Hell !
I said heaven , Heaven and Hell , baby !
Yeah , Heaven , Heaven and Hell !
Yeah !
One , two , three , four !
What's for tea , Mum ?
What's for tea , darling ?
Darling , I said , what's for tea?
What's for tea , daughter ?
Heinz baked beans
When a man is running from his boss
Who hold a gun that fires Cost
And people die from being old
Or left alone because they're cold
And bombs are dropped on fighting cats
And children's dreams are run with rats
If you complain you disappear
Just like the lesbians and queers
No-one can love without the grace
Of some unseen and distant face
And you get beaten up by blacks
Who though they worked still got the sack
And when your soul tells you to hide
Your very right to die is denied
And in the battle on the streets
You fight computers and receipts
And when a man is trying to change
It only causes further pain
You realize that all along
Something in us going wrong
You stop dancing
You can pack up your bags and go looking
For all things that need to be done
Or you can spend all your life not thinking
Never ending what you begun
You take a step in the right direction
But the man knocks us down on the floor
And although he may think we are broken
We'll get up and take two steps more
It's your life to do what you want to
By the way you push yourself out to the fore
And whatever you think of the reason
You bet your life you're here for more
It's your life to do what you want to
By the way you push yourself out to the fore
And whatever you think of the reason
You bet your life you're here for more
You may think that you're pretty good people
And you run at an even score
But whatever you think you are here for
You bet your life you're here for more
Whoa , whoa , whoa whoa , whoa , whoa

Gazing down from Skiddaw , I can see the future
Music , art , and science are gonna bust
Oh , prepare to meet her in this labyrinth
This ancient archive full of dust
I'm a hero , ground zero
If I don't take off I'll surely drown
I'm a hero , ground zero
In the end every leader becomes a clown
Every rock star wants to make a movie
But the darkness is safer than the light
I won't go back to walkdown music
From this old hilltop , I'll take flight
I am a hero , ground zero
In my face , a Klieg lamp burns my eyes
I'm a hero , ground zero
On my back is the heat of a new sunrise
You look so good like spring
I didn't know that looks could kill
In my cave , I could hear you sing
How many rooms can one note fill ?
You raised me up and then you dropped me
I drank and sank , absurd and stoned
I was adopted by the angels
They said my future was postponed
I was a hero , ground zero
I believe my stock has been atoned
I was a hero , ground zero
I felt the shock of being dethroned
Of being disowned
Hey Joe , where you goin' with that gun in your hand
Hey Joe , I said where you goin' with that gun in your hand
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know , I've caught her messin' around with another man
I'm going down to shoot my old lady
You know , I've caught her messin' around with another man
And that ain't too cool
Hey Joe , I've heard you shot your woman down
Shot her down , now
I said I've heard you shot your old lady down
You shot her down to the ground
Yes I did , I shot her
You know , I caught her messin' round , messin' round town
Yes I did , I shot her
You know , I caught my old lady messin' around town
And I gave her the gun
I shot her
Hey Joe , alright
Shoot her one more time , baby
Hey Joe , said now
Where you gonna run to now ?
Where you gonna run to ?
Hey Joe , I said where you gonna run to now ?
Where you , where you gonna go ?
Well , dig it
I'm goin' way down south
Way down to Mexico way
Alright
I'm goin' way down south
Way down where I can be free
Ain't no one gonna find me
Ain't no hangman gonna
He ain't gonna put a rope around me
You better believe it right now
I gotta go now
Hey Joe , you better run on down
Goodbye everybody
Hey Joe , uhh
Run on down
Saw a man about fifty or so
He looked lonely but his eyes were bright
He was walking up the Holland Park Road
And I stopped him to ask for a light
He practically froze when I spoke
But eased when he saw my cigarette
Then I saw as he lit up my smoke
Beneath his coat he was naked and wet
With eyes full of shame
For he knew that I knew
He slumped to the wall with a moan
I said I know there is no name
For what you go through
But how can you do it alone.
I crossed the street to the local new store
Flicked through some cheap magazines
Beside me some school kid I saw
Push some girlie mugs down into his jeans
The shop girl was watching amazed
Asked me to call for the police
She screamed at his blushing young face
And he escaped into the streets
With eyes full of shame
Do it alone , how can you do it alone
I need your help , so I can do it by myself
Do it alone , do not have to breathe down a phone
I have got a clue , 'bout the things that you do
But how...can you do it alone
How can you do it
Back at the flat my girl sat in the shower
And was not too keen on me sharing
She came out well after an hour
And by that time I was past caring
Some women it seems have the knack
Of attaining that stars in their dreams
They simply relax and lay back
While people like us scratch our jeans
With eyes full of shame
And I know it must show
I slump - and I fall and I groan
Will somebody explain
What I need to know
How can you do it alone
How can you do it
How can you do it without any help
How can you do it all by yourself
I see myself on T.V . , I'm a faker , a paper clown
It's clear to all my friends that I habitually lie
I just bring them down
I claim proneness to exaggeration
But the truth lies in my frustration
The children of the night , they all pass me by
Have to drench myself in brandy
In sleep I'll hide
But however much I booze
There ain't no way out
There ain't no way out
I don't care what you say , boy
There ain't no way out
I lose so many nights of sleep worrying about my responsibilities
Are the problems that screw me up really down to him or me
My ego will just confuse me
Some day it's going to up and use me
Dish me out another tailor-made compliment
Tell me about some destiny I can't prevent
And however much I squirm
Won't somebody tell me how to get out of this place ? !
Then the night comes down like a cell door closing
Suddenly I realize that I'm right now , I'm on the scene
While sitting here all alone with a bottle and my head a-floating
Far away from the phone and the conscience going on at me
And on at me , and I don't care what you say
There ain't no way out
Now the walls are all clawed and scratched like by some soul insane
In the morning I hungoverly detach myself , I take no blame
I just can't face my failure
I'm nothing but a well-fucked sailor
You at home can easily decide what's right
By glancing very briefly at the songs I write
But it don't help me that you know
This still ain't no way out
Won't somebody tell me ?
I don't care what you say , boy
There ain't no way out
Give me the key
There ain't no way out
I'm feeling so good right now
There's a handsome boy tells me how I changed his past
He buys me a brandy
But could it be he's really just after my ass ?
He likes the clothes I wear
He says he likes a man who's dressed in season
But no-one else ever stares , he's being so kind
What's the reason ?
How many friends have I really got ?
You can count 'em on one hand
How many friends have I really got ?
How many friends have I really got ?
That love me , that want me , that'll take me as I am ?
Suddenly it's the silver screen
And a face so beautiful that I have to cry out
Everybody hears me
But I look like a fool now
With a cry and I shy out
She knows all of my friends
But it's nice to find a woman who's keen on living
Now I think I've reached the end
I wonder in the dead of night - how do I rate ?
How many friends have I really got ?
How many friends have I really got ?
How many friends have I really got ?
That love me , that want me , that'll take me as I am ?
It's all like a dream you know
When you're still up early in the morning
And you all sit together to watch the sun come through
But things don't look so good
When you could use a bit of warning
Then you know that no-one will ever speak the truth about you
How many friends have I really got ?
Hey-hey , hey-hey
How many friends have I really got ?
How many friends have I really got ?
That love me , that want me , that'll take me as I am ?
When I first signed a contract
It was more than a handshake then
I know it still is
But there's a plain fact
We talk so much shit behind each other's backs
I get the willies
People know nothing about their own soft gut
So how come they can sum us up
Without suffering all the hype we've known
How come they bum us up
How many friends have I really got ?
You can count 'em on one hand
How many friends have I really got ?
How many friends have I really got ?
That love me , that want me , that'll take me as I am?
I am the sea.
Forever , forever ...
Is it me , for a moment ?
Bellboy ! Bellboy !
Love , reign o'er me ...
Can you see the real me , can ya ?
Can ya?
I know you've deceived me
Now here's a surprise
I know that you have
'Cause there's magic in my eyes
I can see for miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
If you think that I don't know about
The little tricks you've played
And never see you when deliberately
You put things in my way
Well , here's a poke at you
You're gonna choke on it too
You're gonna lose that smile
Because all the while
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles
And miles and miles and miles
Oh yeah
You took advantage of my trust in you
When I was so far away
I saw you holding lots of other guys
And now you've got the nerve to say
That you still want me
Well , that's as may be
But you gotta stand trial
Because all the while
I can see for miles and miles

Are mine to see on clear days

To see right through the haze
Well , here's a poke at you
You're gonna choke on it too

Because all the while
I can see for miles and miles
I can see for miles and miles

Miles and miles and miles

I said I can't explain
I'm a billion ages past you
A million years behind you too
A thousand miles up in the air
A trillion times I've seen you there
Your hair is golden , mine is grey
You walk on grass , it turns to hay
Your blood is blue and your eyes are red
My body strains , but the nerves are dead
I can't reach you
I've strained my eyes
I can't reach you
I've split my sides
I can't reach trying to get on you
See , feel or hear from you
The distances grow greater now
You drink champagne and past me plow
You fly your plane right over my head
You're so alive and I'm nearly dead
I can't reach you
With arms outstretched
I can't reach you
I crane my neck
I can't reach trying to get on you
See , feel or hear from you
Once I caught a glimpse of your unguarded , untouched heart
Our fingertips touched and then my mind tore us apart
I can't reach you
With arms outstretched
I can't reach you
I crane my neck
I can't reach trying to get on you
See , feel or hear from you
I can't reach you
With arms outstretched
I can't reach you
I crane my neck
I can't reach trying to get on you
See , feel or hear from you
There's nothing in the way I walk that could tell you where I'm going
There's nothing in the words I speak that can betray anything I'm knowing
Don't think that by the way I dress , you can fit me on a labeled shelf
Don't pretend that you know me , 'cause I don't even know myself
Ooh , I don't know myself
I don't mind if you try once in a while
I don't mind if I cry once in a while
The doors aren't shut as tight as they might seem
I'm just trying to fight my way out of this dream
Don't listen to the words I say , weighing up if I'm enlightened
Don't shiver as you pass me by , cause mister I'm the one who's frightened
The police just came and left , they wanted me and no one else
Don't pretend that you know me cause I don't even know myself
I said I don't know myself
Do you remember me , I don't remember you
Do you still love me , you know I think you do
I have been gone , and some prison warden knows my scream
I'm just trying to fight my way out of this dream
There's only five who know my real name
And my mother don't believe they know it
What she called me is the way I'm staying
And no one'll ever know it
Come on all of you big boys , come on all of you elves
Don't pretend that you know me cause I don't even know myself
I said I don't know myself
I don't mind if you try once in a while
And I don't mind if I cry once in a while
There's nothing in the way I walk that could tell you where I'm going
There's nothing in the words I speak that can betray anything I'm knowing
Don't think about the way I dress , you can fit me on a labeled shelf
Don't pretend that you know me cause I don't even know myself
Ooh I don't know myself
I don't mind if you try once in a while
I don't mind if I cry once in a while

And I don't mind if I cry once in a while
I don't mind your love
I don't mind the one you're thinking of
I know , I know
You're gonna miss me
I don't mind your love so sound
I don't mind , it can't go cold
I know , I know
You're gonna miss me
I don't mind , it's the end of my song
I don't mind , goodbye , so long
I know , said , baby I know
You're gonna miss me
He was drunk , I was blind
Though we tried to be kind
I was sunk , always late
We were quick to rotate
Let's be blunt , I was a bluff
And the surreal life was tough
I was a runt , we told lies
But to our great surprise
All the shit that we did
Brought us some money , I guess
And those snotty young kids
Were a standing success
Helped us conquer and rise
And we learned in this hell
We don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
Life teaches us well
We still pull , we get smug
And we all like a drug
Over full , always sated
Puffed up , elated
Let's admit our mistakes
Are what triggered our breaks
We were shits , so no disguise
And it is no surprise
That the crap that we did
Brought us money , God bless
And those snotty young kids
Were a standing success
Helped us conquer and rise
And we learned in this hell
We didn't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
Life teaches us well
Experiment , you universe
We'll ask why you choose to curse
Why set a fire you plan to douse ?
Why set a rat to catch a mouse ?
He was drunk he was drunk , I was blind he was blind
Though we tried to be kind
I was sunk he was sunk , he was late always late
We were quick to rotate
We tried hard to stay young
But the high notes were sung
We've been scarred , we've been prized
But you could see in our eyes
I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
We got wise !
I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
We got wise
I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
We got wise
I don't wanna get wise
I don't wanna get wise
We got wise
I like nightmares
I like being witless
Watch for the newsflash
Cool eyewitness
Eighty one , eighty two , eighty three , it's happening
Got to be a fucking fool to blame TV , don't get trapped in
If you are lucky be the same as me
I like nightmares , yes I do
There is a simple way to die they call it news
There is a simple way to fly they call it booze
There is an easy quiet escape just sleep and cruise
It is justifiable rape they say you choose
I like nightmares
I like feeling chick less
Flicking my lighter
Watching life flit west
Eighty one , eighty two , eighty three , it is happening
Can we afford to strike three , do not trust the captain
He is just a boy like me
And I like nightmares , yes I do
There is a common way to weep they say just smoke
You can cry yourself to sleep they say just toke
There is a path that never fails you cannot get lost
Do not need roads , you are on rails I will pay the cost
And I like nightmares , yes I do
We were wasted , but you are only waylaid once
What we tasted was a voucher bag and lunch
We robbed their bank and we took their gold
And our lies in the tank must have sounded old
But we pleaded
I said , Your honor , we are not chumps
After all , we only did it once!
We like nightmares
They test our fitness
A full can of goulash
A taint in the mid-west
Eighty one , eighty two , eighty three , it is happening
Nothing floats interest free , do not care what it is wrapped in
You could be abreast like me
And I like nightmares , yes I do
I like nightmares
The time has come for us to see
If you'll take me once again
But darlin' , I'll be back
I'll be reborn
I know I'll always want to be your friend
This life was like climbing
So glad I put the time in
I've got so used to lovin' you
In this life , you so blessed me
Why would I want to get free ?
I've been so happy lovin' you
I've lived too long , lost so much time
I must accept I might be finally dying , yeah
What will survive is my consciousness
It's what I guess
And when I'm alive again , you'll be my happiness
Yes , yes , yes
Next life , I will be climbing again
So glad I put the time in , and then
I'll remember how I once loved only you
In this life , you so blessed me
I would want that again , you see
To be happy again by lovin' you
I was young , Rick guitar
Long hair and big car
No , a big star
Just be happy and go far
Not too far
Love my town , love the boys
Down the Goldhawk Bar
Parkas and boxing boots
Faces were doing toots
We had no cash for that
Just had some hash for that
Lost my virginity
Kate took the piss out of me
Didn't care much who doubted me
Then I found dignity with you
This life was like climbing
I'm so glad I put the time in
I got so used to lovin' you
In this life , you so blessed me
Why would I want to get free ?
I've been so happy lovin' you
Do you believe in life after this ?
What science decries as only a myth
We hang onto dreams like beacons from some ancient days
Then we get on and live out our life
Till we're looking right into the light
We'll only know for sure when we're lost in the haze
The time has come for us to see
If you'll take me once again
But darlin' , I'll be back
I'll be reborn
And I know I'll always want to be your friend
I always want to be your friend
One girl was called Jean Marie
Another little girl was called Felicity
Another little girl was Sally Joy
The other was me , and I'm a boy
My name is Bill and I'm a headcase
They practice making up on my face
Yeah , I feel lucky if I get trousers to wear
Spend evenings taking hairpins from my hair
I'm a boy , I'm a boy
But my ma won't admit it
I'm a boy , I'm a boy
But if I say I am I get it
Get your frock on , Jean Marie
Plait your hair , Felicity
Paint your nails , little Sally Joy
Put this wig on , little Boy
Help me wash up , Jean Marie
You can dry , Felicity
Stack the dishes , Sally Joy
Behind them struggles , I'm a Boy
I wanna play cricket on the green
Ride my bike across the stream
Cut myself and see my blood
I wanna come home all covered in mud
I'm a boy , I'm a boy
But my ma won't admit it
I'm a boy , I'm a boy , I'm a boy
I'm a boy , I'm a boy , I'm a boy , I'm a boy
I'm a boy , I'm a boy , I'm a boy

Imagine a man
Not a child of any revolt
But a plain man tied up in life
Imagine the sand
Running out as he struts
Parading and fading , ignoring his wife
Imagine a road
So long looking backwards
You can't see where it really began
Imagine a load
So large and so smooth
That against it a man is an ant
Then you will see the end
You will see the end
Imagine events
That occur everyday
Like a shooting or raping or a simple act of deceit
Imagine a fence
Around you as high as prevention
Casting shadows , you can't see your feet
Imagine a girl
With long flowing hair
And the body of chalky perfection and truth
Imagine a past
That you wish you had lived
Full of heroes and villains and fools
And you will see the end
You will see the end
And you will see the end
You will see the end
Oh yeah
Imagine a man
Not a child of any revolt
But a man of today feeling new
Imagine a soul
So old it is broken
And you know your invention is you
And you will see the end
You will see the end
You will see the end
You will see the end
Oh yeah
Now when I was a little boy
'Bout the age of five
I had something in my pocket
Keep a lot of folks alive
Now I'm a man
I'm age twenty-one
You know baby , we can have a lotta fun
I'm a man
I spell M-A-N
Man
All you pretty women
Stand in line
I can make love to you baby , in an hour's time
I'm a man
Spelled M-A-N
Man
I'm going back down
To Kansas to
Bring back the second cousin
Little John the conqueroo
I'm a man
Spelled M-A-N
Man
The line I shoot
Will never miss
The way I make love to 'em
They can't resist
I'm a man
I spell M-A-N
Man
I'm a roadrunner , honey
I'm a roadrunner , honey
And you can't keep up with me
Ooh , I'm a roadrunner , honey
And you can't keep up with me
I'm a , you and me
I'm a roadrunner , honey
And you can't keep up with me
Oh yeah , I'm a roadrunner , honey
And you can't keep up with me
I'm gonna show you
Baby , baby , you and me
I'm free , I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free , I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me
If I told you what it takes
To reach the highest high
You'd laugh and say nothing's that simple
But you've been told many times before
Messiahs pointed to the door
And no one had the guts to leave the temple !
I'm free , I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free , I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me
How can we follow ?
How can we follow?
I'm free , I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free , I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me
If I told you what it takes
To reach the highest high
You'd laugh and say nothing's that simple
But you've been told many times before
Messiahs pointed to the door
And no one had the guts to leave the temple !
I'm free , I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free , I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me
How can we follow ?
How can we follow?
I'm free , I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free , I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me
If I told you what it takes
To reach the highest high
You'd laugh and say nothing's that simple
But you've been told many times before
Messiahs pointed to the door
And no one had the guts to leave the temple !
I'm free , I'm free
And freedom tastes of reality
I'm free , I'm free
And I'm waiting for you to follow me
How can we follow ?
How can we follow?
Every year is the same
And I feel it again
I'm a loser
No chance to win
Leaves start falling
Come down is calling
Loneliness starts sinking in
But I'm One
I am One
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the One
Where do you get
Those blue blue jeans
Faded , patched secret , so tight
Where do you get
That walk , oh so lean
Your shoes and your shirts
All just right
But I'm One
I am One
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the One
I got a Gibson
Without a case
But I can't get that even tanned look on my face
Ill fitting clothes
And I blend in the crowd
Fingers so clumsy
Voice too loud
But I'm One
I am One
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the One
I'm the One
Every year is the same
And I feel it again
I'm a loser
No chance to win
Leaves start falling
Come down is calling
Loneliness starts sinking in
But I'm One
I am One
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the One
Where do you get
Those blue blue jeans
Faded , patched secret , so tight
Where do you get
That walk , oh so lean
Your shoes and your shirts
All just right
But I'm One
I am One
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the One
I got a Gibson
Without a case
But I can't get that even tanned look on my face
Ill fitting clothes
And I blend in the crowd
Fingers so clumsy
Voice too loud
But I'm One
I am One
And I can see that this is me
And I will be
You'll all see I'm the One
I'm the One
I'm the face baby , is that clear
I'm the face baby , is that clear
I'm the face if you want it
I'm the face if you want it , dear
All the others are third class tickets by me , baby , is that clear
I'm the big wheel baby
Won't you roll with me
I'm the big wheel baby
Won't you roll with me
So many cats down the scene , honey
Little hard to see
Wear ivy league jackets
White buckskin shoes
I wear ivy league jackets
White buckskin shoes
So many tickets down the scene honey
They're like to blow a fuse
Ain't it funny how they're all Cleopatra
When you gaze into their past
When you find out about their birth signs
You realize there was no need to have asked
All the history of a soul in torment
Ingrained in a hand or face
Ain't it funny how they all fire the pistol
At the wrong end of the race
I am going round and round
I am going round
Going round and round
There's a man going through your dust bin
Only this time he's looking for food
There's a tear in his eye , you don't know him
Oh but you know what he's going through
Ain't it funny that you can't seem to help him
Feeling sick as he staggers away
Is it weird that you hate a stranger
Can a detail correct your dismay
Knowing
Is what people tell you
That you're thinking wrong
Embrace you
But they really mean So long
You talk to them
They laugh aloud
Yet they run to you
In any crowd
Please talk to me again
I need you
We're dancing
We will come and dance near you
We want to learn
Let us come and sitar with you
Distort my ears when
The music's loud
Yet you raise your hatchet
In the yellow crowd
Please talk to me again
I need you
Knowing
Is what people tell you
That you're thinking wrong
Embrace you
But they really mean So long
You talk to them
They laugh aloud
Yet they run to you
In any crowd
Please talk to me again
I need you
Circles , my head is going round in circles
My mind is caught up in a whirlpool
Dragging me down
Time will tell if I'll take the homeward track
Dizziness will make my feet walk back
Walk right back to you
Everything I do , I think of you
No matter how I try , I can't get by
These circles , leading me back to you
Round and around and around and around and around
And around and around and around and around
And round and round like a fool I go
Down and down in the pool I go
Dragging me down
There one thing could kill the pain of losing you
But it gets me so dizzy then I'm walking right back again
Back to you
Time will tell if these dreams are nearly fact
Don't know why I left , I'm coming back
Coming on back to you
Shoop-shoop shoop-sha-wadda-wadda x
I guess you know what makes a party go
If you don't , we better let you know
The reason why I've seen is really hot
Yes , it's all because they're smoking a new cigarette
Shoop-shoop shoop-sha-wadda-wadda x
From East to West the people gather around
DJ's playing really groovy sounds
He blasts the music , I would like more thrills
That's 'cause you really have those Earache problems
Shoop-shoop shoop-sha-wadda-wadda x
Don't hesitate to bring your mum and dad
Hate to think they're in home in bed
What makes grandpa do the Monster Mash ?
It's 'cause me pockets are full of Sausage 'n' Mash!
Shoop-shoop shoop-sha-wadda-wadda x
Shoop-shoop-shoop shoop-shoop-sha-wadda-wadda x
Hit me!
Yeah , man!
That last one was wild!
We got it goin' again!
Woah!
Yee-Haw ! That was the sound , man!
Come along
Into the city
Where the girls are pretty
And you can't go wrong
Take your time
No need to hurry
Don't have to worry
Cause it won't take long
Well you can surf in the city
You can swim in the pools
Do anything you want
Because there ain't no rules
Drive your super-stock car bur to the long highway
And you can drag
In the city in the falling right
The kids are hip and they can dance all night
In the city all the girls are pretty and they go
In the city , into the city
In the ether
I hang suspended
I wait for you
And I know you're near
In this high heaven
My world's upended
I feel no passion
I feel no fear
I'm dizzy with love
But you never appear
In the gloom of this room
Of this cell down here
I know this place
Isn't truly real
And that like my love
It expands and sprays
The light will find me
Will bend toward me
Yet I'm marooned
In a billion days
I'm drunk with you
And I can't explain
Who or where I am
Or how I'm in pain
Rocking and rocking me
Rhythm is shocking me
Just like a child in your fist
You are knocking me
Rocking and rocking
Autistic , caged I am
Rocking and rocking
And rocking enraged
In the ether
In the ether
I wait for you
Hanging in this mist
That I know's unreal
There is nothing there
There's no you , no me
Even though it's crazy
I still appeal
This is heavenly hell
I appear insane
I have no idea
Who there is to blame
I see a man without a problem
I see a country always starved
I hear the music of a heartbeat
I walk and the people turn and laugh
Is it in my head
Is it in my head
Is in my head here at the start ?
Is it in my head
Is it in my head
Is it in my head or in my heart ?
I pick up phones and hear my history
I dream of all the calls I miss
I try to number those who love me
And find exactly what the trouble is
Is it in my head
Is it in my head
Is in my head here at the start ?
Is it in my head
Is it in my head
Is it in my head or in my heart ?
I feel I'm being followed
My head is empty
Yet every word I say turns out a sentence
Statements to a stranger
Just asking for directions
Turn from being help to being questions
I see a man without problem
It's a boy , Mrs . Walker , it's a boy
It's a boy , Mrs . Walker , it's a boy
A son
A son
A son
Any tough can fight - few can play
Any fool can fall - few can lay
Any stud can reproduce - few can please
Anyone can pay - few can lease
It's hard – It's very very very very hard - so very hard
It's hard
It's a hard hard hand to hold
It's a hard land to control
Any man can claim - few can find
Any girl can blink - few can lie
Anyone can promise - few can raise
Anyone can try - but a few can stay
It's hard – It's very very very very hard - so very hard
It's hard
It's a hard hard hand to hold
It's a hard land to control
Any brain can hide - few can stand
Any kid can fly - few can land
Any gang can scatter - few can form
Any kid can chatter - few can inform
It's hard – It's very very very very hard - so very hard
It's hard
It's a hard hard hand to hold
It's a hard land to control
Any soul can sleep - few can die
Any wimp can weep - few can cry
Everyone complains - few can state
Anyone can stop - but few can wait
It's hard – It's very very very very hard - so hard
Anyone can do anything if they hold the right card
So I am thinking about my life now
I am thinking very hard
Deal me another hand Lord , this one's very hard
I read your letter and the things you say
You say power chords are all that we should play
Well this is what you are going to eat today , Virginia
Cause if power chords are what you say you need
Look inside your body , baby , you will see
That man in air and flying seed is in you
You got it in you
But if you depend on me to make you rock and roll
Well you better look out itch , because we are getting old
Look inside and check out your neglected soul , Virginia
Cause I can seem to dance out all alone on the scene
Or VIP and fight down at the music machine
But as for you , the place to look for rock and roll is in you
You got it in you
You got it in you
You know you got it in you
It is in you
You got it in you
Your letter came and today is the eighth
This is the day that Moonie earned his wraith
And it makes me want to tell you stuff on letters
Dear Virginia
And if you really care then better stay awake
Take me out again , baby , and say that I am a fake
And you can then forsake the part of me that's in you
Oh , it is in you
Oh now , you got me in you
Ooh , yeah , it's all in you
Can you feel it in you ?
You got it in you
You have got it in your heart
You got it in you
I am just a tiny part of what is in you
Please remember , darling , sweet Virginia
That everything you need's already in you
Well I forgive completely all your lack of tact
My patience's holding out and it's a hard-earned fact
That I could easily buy your time
Dearest Virginia
But you will always give me just one more chance
You will hang around and ask me for a chance to dance
But I cannot make you jump , baby , if it is not in you
You have got it in you
You got it in your heart
You have got it in you
You know , I am just a tiny part of what is in you
Please remember darling , sweet Virginia
Everything you need's already in you
Oh yeah , you've got it in you
You got me in you
Hey , tich
Toe-rag
Mmm tossed
You got me in you
You got it in you
Oh , you know it is in you
It's not enough
Whatever you give
A little bit more
You always need
A little more man
A little more seed
It's not enough
It's not enough
Whatever I give
It's never enough
I gave you cash
I gave you love
All that I heard
Was It's Not Enough
I work so hard
It gets so tough
Whatever I give
Never feels like enough
It's not enough
It's not enough
Whatever I give
It's never enough
When I'm on my knees
I keep taking your stuff
Make sure that you know
It's never enough
You said you'd go as far
As to turn to my friend
Who once warned me of you
Said you'd hasten my end
Because I have lent
Every ounce of my juice
My essence is spent
You'll always want
A little more pink
I'll always need
A little more ink
However I praise
However I puff
Though you may smile
It won't be enough
Right at the end
When I start to bluff
An' the lift's going down
An' I start acting tough
I'll find someone else
To finish filling me up
I'll smile and admit
You were never quite enough
Like Brigitte Bardot
In Godard's Les Mepris
I can't love you enough
To make you complete
You appear in my dreams
With some new courtier
You need me there to see
What you need to convey
No hysterical scene
You will never play rough
I'm the one who will scream
But it won't be enough
It's never enough
I'll never hold you
How can I scold you ?
It's not true
You say I've been in prison
You say I've got a wife
You say I've had help doing
Everything throughout my life
It's not true , it's not true
I'm telling you
Because I'm up here and you're nowhere
It's not true , so there
I haven't got eleven kids
I weren't born in Baghdad
I'm not half-Chinese either
And I didn't kill my dad
If you hear more rumours
You can just forget them too
Fools start the rumours
None of them are true
Up here on the ledge
I am getting pushed to the edge
People line up behind me to step into my shoes
Up here in the precipice
I am getting close to my nemesis
People fighting each other to jump into my blues
There's a young kid inside me somewhere
He stays up all night , a vampire that never dies
With the blood and the moon in his eyes
I hear his voice when I am coming down
Sleep is for fools , who never see the sunrise
Who never get to live twice
I was a face in a magazine
When you were still playing with your plasticine
Now you are dogging my tail , riding the slipstream
You can take the fans and the enemies
The little girls who squeeze and tease
Then pass on their social disease
Go get your penicillin
I know you young and dumb
I know where you are coming from
Do not know where you're going to
But I been there same as you
You're running out of ideas
And new hats to try on
I know you middle age
Same song , different page
I know what you are going through
Made the same mistakes as you
All you want is some hope
And a shoulder to cry on
There is a stranger inside me somewhere
That shadow behind me , don't even look like me
An echoed apology
He's a wolf in a sheep's disguise
I wake up in places I don't even recognize
Pretender in paradise
It's your turn , step up and take it
If you've got the guts to hang on
You can make it
Come on , come on , come on
Oh take it!
One , two , three
Two , two , three
I've been away so long
Wonder where I went wrong
I spent the last year inside a cell
Never ever go away again
I've been so sad and lonely
Never ever ever gonna go away again
It's a waste of time doing time
When you didn't commit the crime
It wasn't me , it was my brother Bill
Emptied out the till , never gonna speak to Bill again
He's made me sad and lonely
Never ever gonna speak to brother Bill again
It was no use , they put my brother on the jury
He bribed the others 'cause he owns the local brewery
They let me out today
Brother Bill's gonna pay
No one's ever gonna speak to Bill again
Never ever speak to Bill again
He'll be too cold and bony
Never ever gonna go away again
Never ever gonna go away again
Never ever gonna go away again
You were under the impression
That when you were walking forwards
That you'd end up further onward
But things ain't quite that simple
You got altered information
You were told to not take chances
You missed out on new dances
Now you're losing all your dimples
My jacket's going to be cut and slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck
I ride a GS scooter with my hair cut neat
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet
Love rain on me
Rain on me
Love rain on me
Love
I've had enough of living
I've had enough of dying
I've had enough of smiling
I've had enough of crying
I've taken all the high roads
I've squandered and I've saved
I've had enough of childhood
I've had enough of graves
Get a job and fight to keep it
Strike out to reach a mountain
Be so nice on the outside
But inside keep ambition
Don't cry because you hunt them
Hurt them first , they'll love you
There's a millionaire above you
And you're under his suspicion
My jacket's going to be cut and slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck
I ride a GS scooter with my hair cut neat
Wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet
Love rain on me
Rain on me
Love rain on me
Love
Had enough of dancehalls
I've had enough of pills
I've had enough of streetfights
I've seen my share of kills
I'm finished with the fashions
And acting like I'm tough
I'm bored with hate and passion
I've had enough of trying to love
I have known no war
And if I ever do I won't know for sure
Who will be fighting whom
For the soldier's lonely tomb
Now opens as soon as the referee's gun starts to roar
I will know no war
Galbraith took his pen
To break down the men
Of the German army defeated
On the nineteenth day
Of a spring day in May
Albert Speer was deleted
And as soon as the battle was over
I was born in victorious clover
And I have never been shot at or gassed
Never tortured or stabbed
And I am sure – I will never know war
I know I will never know war
And if I ever do
The glimpse will be short
Fireball in the sky
No front line battle cries
Can be heard as the button is pushed
By a soul that's been bought
I'll know no war
In and out of reach loft
The medals are lost
They belong to a lone broken sailor
His provinces now
Are the bars of the town
His songs and his poems of failure
For his grandchildren can't see the glory
And his own kids are bored with the story
But for him they'd have burned behind netting
From the brink they were grabbed
And I am sure
I'll never know war
I've known no war
And if I ever do I won't know for sure
Who will be fighting whom
For the soldiers lonely tomb
Now opens as soon as the referee's gun starts to roar
I'll know no war
War – I have known no war
I'll never know war
And if I ever know it
The glimpse will be short
Fireball in the sky
No front line battle cries
Can be heard as the button is pushed by a soul that's been bought
And the armies remaining will judge without people or courts
And there's no point pretending that knowing will help us abort
I'll know no war
Grace , space , race
Everything they've seen , you have seen
Everywhere they've been , you have been
Everything they've done , you have been
And done already
Every lovely spot , near or far
You can reach them , too , in your car
Or you might be there now
If you own a jag already
The radio blasting
The girls are glancing
The dash is dancing
With gleaming dials
Grace , space , pace
Grace , space , race
Jaguar
Jaguar
Jaguar
Jaguar
Yeah!

Won't you join together with the band
Ev'rybody join together
Won't you join together
Come on and join together with the band

Won't you join together
Come on and join together with the band
Joker James , you did it again , caused somebody pain
You lived up to your name , Jimmy , Joker James
Sally was a stamp collector , pretty little girl
One day she dated James , bringing love into her world
A tense romantic moment as they sat down on the couch
The whoopee cushion roared and I'm afraid it's over now
He's a joker...
Joker James , you did it again , caused somebody pain
You lived up to your name , didn't you , Joker James
Lucy was a cool one , always got her high
Then she dated James and true love took her higher
The jester had suggested a new way to get stoned
Put itching powder down her neck and now she's all alone
Joker James , you did it again , caused somebody pain
You lived up to your name , didn't you , Joker James
Sense of humor cannot woo her
You just threw another wheeze her way
Wizard pranks won't get you thanks
You just threw another love away
Alice was a different kettle , always wore a smile
Her skin felt like heaven and laughter all the while
Her sense of humor throws him and deep in love he falls
But when he tries to sign the paper the rubber pencil falls
He's a joker...
Joker James , you're not to blame , the joke's on you , now you're blue
It's such a shame , but that's the game , Joker James
Joker James , you did it again , caused somebody pain
You lived up to your name , Jimmy , Joker James

You can run miles and breathe easy
Feel the cool fresh air at least the hold you don't can’t see
Do you want kids ?
Wanna see your kids , kids ?
If you do you better come out of the mist , kids !
That love affair with a cigarette
Will end on the rocks baby you can bet
Better smoke as many as you can get
Before your lungs are locked and you end in debt to yourself
Do you want kids ?
Wanna see your kids , kids ?
If you do you better come out of the mist , kids !
Come on now !
Will power can be poor health
You can't help nobody else until you help yourself
If I'm so lost without a friend
Tell me , who's this by my side ?
This girl with eyes like gems
And cool reactions to your lies

All the things that made me cry
You kicked me when I was down
And they hurt me all those lies
Lies
La la la la la la lies
I've got my girl and together we're strong
To laugh at you and prove you wrong
I don't insist that you feel bad
I just want to see you smile
Don't ever think you made me mad
I didn't listen to your lies
Lies

If I'm so lost without a friend
Tell me , who's this by my side ?
This girl with eyes like gems
And cool reactions to your lies
Lies

Little Billy was the fattest kid in his class
Always the last in line
All the other little kids would laugh at him
Said he'd die before his time
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Little Billy didn't mind
Most of the kids smoked cigarettes
Just to prove that they were cool
The teacher didn't know about the children's games
And Billy always followed the rules
Billy was big on the outside
But there's an even bigger man inside
Ten million cigarettes burning every day
And Billy's still doing fine
Now Billy and his classmates are middle-aged
With children of their own
Their smoking games are reality now
And cancer's seed is sown
Most of them smoke maybe forty a day
A habit Billy doesn't share
One by one they're passing away
Leaving orphans to Billy's care
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Little Billy doesn't mind
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Little Billy's doing fine

Surrounded by people
A real heavy crowd
But inside I still feel lonely now
Should I get away
From the high heels so proud
Is there something different life can show me now
First chance - I blew it , I better start it all again
Second chance - Ooh , I knew it wouldn't be as easy as they said
Third chance - I'm cut up , life's like a razor's edge
Fourth chance - Ooh , I'm all shut up and I'm standing on the ledge
And I'm going down I'm going down
Going down I'm going down
Ooh , down
I'm not a loser
But did I really win ?
Can I afford to go through it all again ?
I hope I don't sound
As immature as I feel
But when I get wise , I'll give you a call , my friend
Love is coming down on me , ooh yeah
Love is burning , teaching , turning out in me
Love is coming down , down

Whenever I'm with you
Something inside
Starts to burn deep
And my heart's filled with fire
Could be that I'm very sentimental
Or is this just the way love's supposed to be ?
I got a heat wave
Burning in my heart
I can't keep from crying
Tearing me apart
Sometimes she calls my name
Yeah , yeah , yeah , I can't explain
I feel , yeah I feel
I feel this burning flame
This high blood pressure's got a hold on me
'Cause it's just the way love's supposed to be
I got a heat wave

I can't keep from crying
Tearing me apart
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Just give me another chance
This could be a new romance

She wants a man with lots of money
Not a poor boy
He buys her things she calls him honey
She calls me poor boy
What good could it do
To give a love pure and true
When any fool could understand
She thinks that money makes the man
She wants a man with lots of money
Not a poor boy
She wants the things she'll buy with money
Not a poor boy
A man with money , a man with money , a man with money
Just down the street
I know a place
When they're asleep
I'll cover my face
I'll break the lock
Open the door
I'll slip inside
I'll rob the store
Then I'll be a man with lots of money
Not a poor boy
I'll buy her things , she'll call me honey
Not a poor boy
A man with money , a man with money , a man with money , man with money
I danced with Linda
I danced with Jean
I danced with Cindy
Then I suddenly see
Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her man
Those shaky hands
Mary is so pretty
The prettiest in the land
Guys come from every city
Just to shake her shaky hands
Linda can cook
Jean reads books
Cindy can sew
But I'd rather know
Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her man
Those shaky hands
Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her man
Those shaky hands
Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to her man
Those shaky hands
I danced with Linda
I danced with Jean
I danced with Cindy
Then I suddenly see
Mary-Anne with the shaky hands
What they've done to a man
Those shaky hands
Mary is so pretty

Henry Pond had no fun
Had a face like a currant bun
This adolescent little fella
Was nicknamed by his friends Old Yella
The doctors gave him creams and lotions
To try to sooth the boy's emotions
But all in vain; the acne stayed
Henry's hopes began to fade
Then , when just about to crack
He found another cream - Medac
When Henry in the mirror peered
His pimples all had disappeared
Henry laughed and yelled I got 'em !
Me face is like a baby's bottom
My face looks like a baby's bottom
One , two—
Put some real soul in this
One , two , three
Yeah , that will probably do it
My coffee's cold , my paper's old
My heart is sold to melancholia
My clothes are torn , my shoes are worn
My heart is born to melancholia
A strange surprise , what I despised
In other guys is here in me
They lose their girl , they lose their world
And then they cry for all to see
I've never felt so bad
The virus drives me mad
The sheets are grey , left since the day
She went away , I lost all power
The dust is thick , the dog is sick
The kids have picked most of the flowers
The sun is shining
But not for me
The sun is shining
But not for me
I've never felt so bad
The virus drives me mad
The sheets are grey , left since the day
She went away , I lost all power
The dog is sick , the dust is thick
The kids have picked most of the flowers
We're not strong enough
We're not alone enough , or cold enough
Emotionally we're not even old enough
Late at night , we're in a video-game dream
There is no lover in this numbered scene
We summon every childhood ghost we've ever seen
Then suddenly we hear that Mike Post theme
Everything is all right bong de bong
We've prayed today la-da-da-da-dah
Everything is OK bong de bong
We've played today
Late at night on the underground train
Through endless suburbs in endless pain
Then deep in the tunnel under the London rain
Suddenly we hear Mike Post again
Everything is all right bong de bong
We've prayed today la-da-da-da-dah
If there really is a God dong de bong
We should be laid today
We watch those films
That make men cry
Young lovers kiss
Then fight and die
We start to yearn
We climb the vine
We have to face
The truth some time
But late at night we find the racing tame
We're faced with women and a reality game
We feel alive; we feel new and blind
We're hearing Mike Post in the air this time
There comes a time in every little punk's life
Where he has to right a song for his common-law wife
We make our women wait until they want to scream
But we can always whistle that Mike Post theme

If you don't hear me , how can I tell you
If you don't listen , why should I speak
If you're indifferent , how can I reach you
Just 'cos you're angry don't assume I'm weak
Howling Wolf , and old Link Wray
Dave Van Ronk and Doris Day
Bobby Darin , Brownie McGhee
Elvis , Buddy and Eddie C
Music makes me , makes me strong
Strong vibrations , make me long
Long for a place where I belong
You will find me in this song
Who will walk through the mirror door
Will there be music , or will there be war
Will we be rich , or will we be poor
Who will walk through the mirror door
A thousand angels , a million children
Fire and fear in a suicide eye
Golden stairway to a Zeppelin heaven
Rolling thunder under New York sky
Frank 'n' Ella , Ray 'What'd I Say'
Johnny Cash and Johnnie Ray
Amadeus and Ludvig Van
Henry , Johann and the doo dah band
We are here in celebration
This music's going to make us strong
We climb up high , to the golden station
Curtis Mayfield ain't waiting long
Get on board...

Yeah , outside the house Mr . Simpson announced
That Sally couldn't go to the meeting
He went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce
And she ran inside a-weeping
She got to her room and tears splashed the picture
Of her new messiah
She picked up a book of her father's life
And threw it on the fire
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said Never mind
Your part is to be
What you'll be
The theme of the sermon was
Come Unto Me And Love Will Find a Way
But Sally decided to ignore her dad
And sneak out anyway
She spent all afternoon getting ready
And decided she'd try to touch him
Maybe he'd see that she was free
And talk to her this Sunday
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said Never mind
Your part is to be
What you'll be
She arrived by six and the place was swinging
To gospel music by nine
Group after group appeared on the stage
And Sally just sat there crying
She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture
Right in the very front row
Then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge
Went on and said Here we go!
The crowd went crazy
As Tommy hit the stage
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage
Soon the atmosphere was cooler
And Tommy gave a lesson
Sally just had to let him know she loved him
And leapt up on the rostrum
She ran across stage to the spotlit figure
And touched him on the face
Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man
Threw her off the stage
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said Never mind
Your part is to be
What you'll be
Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down
Mingling with her tears
Tommy carried on preaching
And his voice filled Sally's ears
She caught his eye and she had to try
But he couldn't see through the light
Her face was gashed and the ambulance men
Had to carry her out that night
The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage
Little Sally was lost
For the price of a touch
And a gash across her face
Oooooh !
Sixteen stitches put her right and her dad said
Don't say I didn't warn ya!
Sally got married to a rock musician
She met in California
Tommy always talks about the day
The disciples all went wild
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
To remind her of his smile
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her mother said Never mind
Your part is to be
What you'll be
NORA :
Tommy can you hear me ?
Tommy can you hear me ?
Tommy can you hear me ?
Tommy can you hear me ?
Tommy , Tommy , Tommy , Tommy ?
TOMMY :
Mother ! Father !
Touch me , feel me ...
Who am I ? Where did I come from ?
Have you known me ? Have you seen me ?
Mother ?
NORA :
You’re a hero , you are famous
You’re a champion of the young
You are rich , but it’s so absurd to try
To explain all the things you’ve done
You’re adored and you’re loved
Thousands watch you play
Pinball ! It’s a fever
And you’re the master of the game
And now that you’re whole
You’ll be champion of the very soul
TOMMY :
Yes , I’m healed :
Delivered from silent darkness
No more locked doors
Or stifled screams !
Pinball ?
What I see now before me
Is far beyond a game
Beyond your wildest dreams !
Those who love me have a higher path to follow now
And you , dear Mother , too , must be prepared!
I say hey hey everybody come on let's go for a ride , motorvating
Yeah grab your baby and pull her right by your side , motorvating
Go around to Main Street and go on right over to here , motorvating

And when it starts to rain turn your wipers on , motorvating
Yeah motorvating , yeah yeah yeah , I said yeah yeah , motorvating
Much too much to bear
Your love is hard and fast
Your love will always last
If it's you I need
I've got to pay the levy
Got to pay
'Cause your love's too heavy on me
And it's much too much to bear
If I ever leave you , darlin'
I hope you see
That I really love you
But your love's too heavy on me
And it's much too much to bear
When I make love to you
Do all the things you want me to do
You never think of me
Always cry a bevy
Bevy of tears
'Cause your love's too heavy on me
And it's much too much to bear
There was a time I could give all I had to you
But my enthusiasm waned , and I can't bear the pain
Of doing what I don't want to do
Much too much to bear
Your love is hard and fast
Your love will always last
If it's you I need
I've got to pay the levy
Got to pay
'Cause your love's too heavy on me
And it's much too much to bear
Deep in the back of my mind is an unrealized sound
Every feeling I get from the street says it soon could be found
When I hear the cold lies of the pusher , I know it exists
It's confirmed in the eyes of the kids , emphasized with their fists
But the high has to rise from the low
Like volcanoes explode through the snow
The mosquito's sting brings a dream
But the poisons derange
The music must change
For we're chewing a bone
We soared like the sparrow hawk flied
Then we dropped like a stone
Like the tide and the waves
Growing slowly in range
Crushing mountains as old as the Earth
So the music must change
Sometimes at night , I wake up and my body's like ice
The sound of the running wild stallion , the noise of the m-m-mice
And I wondered if then I could hear into all of your dreams
I realize now it was really the sound of your screams
But death always leads into life
But the street fighter swallows the knife
Am I so crazy to feel that it's here prearranged
The music must change
It's gets higher and higher
Smouldering like leaves in the sun
Then it bursts into fire
Its rhythm grows strong
It's so new and so strange
Like bells in the clouds , then again
The music must change
But is this song so different
Am I doing it all again
It may have been done before
But then music's an open door
The music must change
For we're chewing a bone
We soared like the sparrow hawk flied
Then we dropped like a stone
Like the tide and the waves
Growing slowly in range
Crushing mountains as old as the Earth
The music must change

Well , come on , pretty baby , let's go out tonight
Your mom won't have to worry , everything'll be alright
Don't let me hear you talking , just be there when I call
'Cause what I do I do my way or it won't be done at all
Little girl , can you hear what I say ?
I'm an easy going guy but I always gotta have my way
Yeah , I was born a tiger , always had my way
Don't ever try to change me this or any other day
Don't let me hear you argue the things I say I do
Don't give me no trouble or you all and I are through
Little girl , can you hear what I say ?
Yeah , I'm an easy going guy but I always gotta have my way
Well , come on , pretty baby , let's go out tonight

Yeah , I'm an easy going guy but I always gotta have my way
I'm an easy going guy but I always gotta have my way
You better believe it , baby
My life's in jeopardy
Murdered in cold blood is what I'm gonna be
I ain't been home since Friday night
And now my wife is coming after me
Give me police protection
I'm gonna buy a gun so I can look after number one
Give me a bodyguard , a black belt Judo expert
With a machine gun
Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane
When she catches up with me , won't be no time to explain
She thinks I've been with another woman
And that's enough to send her half insane
Gonna buy a fast car , put on my lead boots
And take a long , long drive
I may end up spending all my money
But I'll still be alive
All I did was have a bit too much to drink
And I picked the wrong precinct
Got picked up by the law
And now I ain't got time to think
Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane
When she catches up with me , won't be no time to explain
She thinks I've been with another woman
And that's enough to send her half insane
Gonna buy a fast car , put on my lead boots
And take a long , long drive
I may end up spending all my money
But I'll still be alive
And I'm oh-so tired of running
Gonna lay down on the floor
I've gotta rest some time
So I can get to run some more , yeah
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
My life's
In jeopardy
Murdered in cold blood is what I'm gonna be
I ain't been home since Friday night and now my wife
Is comin' after me
Give me police protection
Gonna buy a gun so I can look after number one
Give me a bodyguard a black belt judo expert
With a machine gun
Gonna buy a tank and an aeroplane
When she catches up with me won't be no time to explain
She thinks I've been with another woman and that's enough

She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
She's comin'
Take a little dope
And walk out in the air
The stars are all connected to the brain
Find me a woman
And lay down on the ground
Her pleasure comes falling down like rain
Get myself a car
I feel power as I fly
Oh , now I'm really in control
It all looks fine to the naked eye
But it don't really happen that way at all
Don't happen that way at all
You sign your own name
And I sign mine
They're both the same but we still get separate rooms
You can cover up your guts
But when you cover up your nuts
You're admitting that there must be something wrong
Press any button
And milk and honey flows
The world begins behind your neighbor's wall
It all looks fine to the naked eye
But it don't really happen that way at all , nah nah no
Don't happen that way at all
You hold the gun
And I hold the wound
And we stand looking in each other's eyes
Both think we know what's right
Both know we know what's wrong
We tell ourselves so many , many , many lies
We're not pawns in any game
Not tools of bigger men
There's only one who can really move us all
It all looks fine to the naked eye
But it don't really happen that way at all
You need a new song
I'll set the words up so they tear right at your soul
Don't take me too long
But there's a danger that I'll plagiarize something old
My fingers kill me as I play my guitar
Cause I've been chewing down at my nails
My hairline ain't exactly superstar
But there's one thing that never fails
This never fails
I write the same old song with a few new lines
And everybody wants to cheer it
I write the same old song you heard a good few times
Admit you really want to hear it
Whenever I see you
You always treat me like I'm some kind of perfect man
Just cause I please you
You explain , but you don't think I can understand
My head is spinning as I scrawl with my pen
Cause I've been pouring vodka in my soul
Nothing really ever changes my friend
New lamps for old
New lamps for old
We sing the same old song , just like a vintage car
You can look but you won't ever drive it
We drink the same old wine from a brand new jar
We get hung over , but we always survive it
Turn on the radio
Love is proclaimed
Again and again and again
Join in and sing
Now , don't be ashamed
Let it rain , let it rain , let it rain
Let it rain , let it rain , let it rain
Let it rain
Let it rain
We hum the same old lines to a different crowd
And everybody wants to cheer it
We run on endless time to reach a higher cloud
But we never ever seem to get near it
yo yo yo
When you look through the lights to the stage
You see the man of your dreams
You think his life's full of parties and love
But it's not what it seems
If you could see in his room right now
You'd see how much love is showed
There's never really any romance on the road
His forehead seems cut in two
By the crease in his brown
He chews his nails and he fidgets
Just trying to settle on down
The TV channels keep flipping
His adrenaline slowed
There's never really any romance on the road , oh no
There's never romance on the road
Only frustration and overload
He could fall in love but he'd never know
For she's only riding and he's only hiding
He's sure to ask but she won't say , No
But there's never really any romance on the road
He was up in the bar straight-backed
Did you see him before ?
Did he sign you his name ?
Come with me , listenin' at his door
Hear himself so drunk calling home
Can't remember the code
You know , there's never really any romance on the road
Oh no , no , no
He's held some beautiful girls in his arms
But now he clutches his bunk
For all the good that they're doing him now
He might as well be a monk
For his memories ain't worth a thing
Till he's old and he's gone
And his past never quite catches up
The show's movin' on
Did he say he kept a picture
Of a blonde haired girl who'd been kind ?
When he was last home , his own daughter
Brought it into his mind
Maybe closing bars and jets
Paid some debts that he owed
But there's never really any romance on the road
There's never romance on the road
Only frustration and overload
He's never learned a thing from the dust that blowed
On stage for an hour , on a laser beam tower
But you know he slept while the neon glowed
There's never really any romance on the road
I've got a spade and a pick-axe
And a hundred miles square of land to churn about
My old horse is weary but sincerely
I believe that he can pull a plough
Well , I've moved into the jungle of the agriculture rumble
To grow my own food
And I'll dig and plough and scrape the weeds
Till I succeed in seeing cabbage growing through
Now I'm a farmer
And I'm digging , digging , digging , digging , digging
Now I'm a farmer
And I'm digging , digging , digging , digging , digging
It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming
How calming and balming the effect of the air
Well , I farmed for a year and grew a crop of corn
That stretched as far as the eye can see
That's a whole lot of cornflakes
Near enough to feed New York till
Cultivation is my station and the nation
Buys my corn from me immediately
And holding sixty thousand bucks , I watch as dumper trucks
Tip New York's corn flakes in the sea
Now I'm a farmer
And I'm digging , digging , digging , digging , digging
Now I'm a farmer
And I'm digging , digging , digging , digging , digging
It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming
How calming and balming the effect of the air
Now look here , son
The right thing to say
Isn't necessarily what you wanna say
The right thing to do
Isn't necessarily what you wanna do
The right things to grow
Ain't necessarily what you wanna grow
Your own happiness
Doesn't necessarily teach you what you wanna know
Well I'm suntanned and deep , so's the horse
And my hands are deeply grained
Old horse is a-grazing , it's amazing
Just how lazily he took the strain
Well my pick and spade are rusty
'Cause I'm paid on trust
To leave my square of cornfield bare
It's alarming how charming it is to be a-farming
How calming and balming the effect of the air
When you grow what I grow
Tomatoes , potatoes , stew
Eggplants
Potatoes , tomatoes , ha
Gourds
She sang the best she'd ever sang
She couldn't ever sing any better
But Mister Davidson never rang
She knew he would forget her
She'd seen him there
And put herself to ransom
He had stared
He really was quite handsome
She had really looked her best
She couldn't ever look any better
But she knew she'd failed the test
She knew he would forget her
Triumphant ! was the way she felt
As she acknowledged the applause
Triumphant ! was the way she'd felt
When she saw him at the dressing room door
She was happier than she'd ever been
As he praised her for her grace
But his expression changed , she had seen
As he leant to kiss her face
It ended there
He claimed a late appointment
She quickly turned
To hide her disappointment
She ripped her glittering gown
Couldn't face another show , no
Her deodorant had let her down
She should have used Odorono
Old red wine
Well past its prime
May have to finish it
After crossing the line
Dusty old wine
Two thousand a time
An inch of black mud
Always left behind
They say you turned in
While the sun still shined
That gorgeous girl with you
Was highly primed
She said she'd take you
Way down or way up
She might break your heart
She might crack you up
Old red wine
Not worth a dime
Gonna have to drink it with yer
Some other time
Expensive old wine
Forty years lying
Mice chewed the labels
Don't know what we're buying
Back home in California
They got wine for the meek
There's the Bowl and the Fillmore
The Cow and the Greek
You sniffed at the cork
Chose low on the list
Held your glass to the light
And gazed through the mist
Old red wine
Well past its prime
May have to finish it
After crossing the line
Let it breathe
Let it breathe
One at a time
Always ready to fight over the little things
One at a time , she is
Always ready to fight over the little things
She is going crazy and the table starts shaking
She is been abusing her body again
Her vision gets hazy and the bottles start breaking
She has been seeing that man again
If you want her , you can keep her
'Cos I can only handle one at a time
You can take her
I have got someone waiting in line
And I would like to
But I can only handle one at a time
One at a time
I found out she's continually cheating
She insists , she so innocent
So I stayed out at another late meeting
And she waited up for another argument
I am moving on to something better
There must be something better than this
She's got me so confused
As to who's being used
Call her up right away
You have got her number
And I promise not to answer the phone
You can pick her up in your clapped out Humber
I just hope it can get you home
There's a scene
Indelible , it hangs before my eyes
In our teens , incredibly
Together with no ties
That was a life enough for me
One life's enough for me
Throw back your head
Let your body curve
Into the long grass of the bed
Pull me down into your hair
And I will push and swerve
As we both gasp in the evening air
Yeah
Our love was
Our love was famine , frustration
We only acted out an imitation
Of what real love should have been
Then suddenly
Our love was flying
Our love was soaring
Our love was shining
Like a summer morning
Flying , soaring
Shining morning
Never leaving
Lying , dying
Love , love , love long
Love , love , love long
Love , love , love long
Love , love , love long
Love , love , love long
Love , love , love long
Love , love , love long
Love , love , love long
Our love was flying
Our love was soaring
Our love was shining
Like a summer morning
Our love was famine , frustration
We only acted out an imitation
Of what real love should have been
Then suddenly
Our love was flying
Our love was soaring
Our love was shining
Like a summer morning
Out in the street
I'm talking about slowly
I'm not going to rest
Woman , you don't know me
Yeah , you don't know me , no
Know me , no
Know me , no
Yeah , but I'm a-going to know you
Hey listen , woman
You just can't throw me
I won't stand it
If you don't know me
Listen to me
I'm telling you
You look at me , woman
Yeah , tell the truth
I know your mind
I can see that you're in need
I'll show you woman
Yeah , that you belong to me
Give me no reasons
Said you'd go free
It's not going to be now
If you got to know me
Captain Walker didn't come home
His unborn child will never know him
Believe him missing with a number of men
Don't expect to see him again
Captain Walker didn't come home
His unborn child will never know him
Believe him missing with a number of men
Don't expect to see him again
It's a boy , Mrs . Walker , it's a boy
It's a boy , Mrs . Walker , it's a boy
A son
A son
A son

Pete : We'd like to carry on now and play a song originally recorded by Mose Allison , who's really a jazz musician , and I did read something on one of his record covers which said he was a jazz sage . Quite what that means , I don't know , uh
Keith : He's a flavour of chicken !
Pete : And , when we picked up quite a number of his songs . Eyesight To The Blind , which was on the Tommy album , and also this song , which I think has got to be one of his best , it's one of his own compositions which he wrote when he was about fourteen
Keith : Teenager !
Pete : Just a mere teenager , and he called it Young Man Blues
Uh , when we were last at the Fillmore in New York , we had a bit of a problem with a alleged police officer , and tomorrow morning at nine o'clock we've got to be in court in New York . No way , no way ... we gotta catch a plane at eleven thirty . We've really got to go . Thanks very much
Now I'm in the ether
Look down at time
I see three children
Prepare to walk the line
I see them older
When life is done
I was a loser
At the game they won
Come on let's try
To pick up the peace
You and I
On our hands and knees
Come on let's try
To touch the Fleece
Come on let's try
To pick up the peace
How do old people forget
That the wars we've seen
Are about me longing for you
You longing for me?
I used to wake up in the morning
I used to feel so bad
I got so sick of having sleepless nights
I went and told my dad
He said , Son , now , here's some little somethings
And stuck them on my wall
And now my nights ain't quite so lonely
In fact I , I don't feel bad at all
I don't feel bad at all
Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night
Pictures of Lily solved my childhood problems
Pictures of Lily helped me feel alright
Pictures of Lily
Lily , oh Lily
Lily , oh Lily
Pictures of Lily
And then one day , things weren't quite so fine
I fell in love with Lily
I asked my dad where Lily I could find
He said , Son , now don't be silly
She's been dead since
Oh , how I cried that night
If only I'd been born in Lily's time
It would have been alright
Pictures of Lily made my life so wonderful
Pictures of Lily helped me sleep at night
For me and Lily are together in my dreams
And I ask you , Hey mister , have you ever seen
Pictures of Lily?"
Ever since I was a young boy , I've played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton , I must've played 'em all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
That deaf , dumb , and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
He stands like a statue , becomes part of the machine
Feelin' all the bumpers , always playin' clean
Plays by intuition , the digit counters fall
That deaf , dumb , and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
He's a pinball wizard , there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist
How do you think he does it ? I don't know !
What makes him so good ?
Ain't got no distractions , can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see no lights a-flashin' , plays by sense of smell
Always gets the replay , never seen him fall
That deaf , dumb , and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
I thought I was the Bally table king
But I just handed my pinball crown to him
Even on my favorite table , he can beat my best
His disciples lead him in , and he just does the rest
He's got crazy flipper fingers , never seen him fall
That deaf , dumb , and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball
Ever since I was a young boy , I've played the silver ball

It's Poetry Cornered
And when I look upon your face
I would that we were in some place
Where you could be my pet
My dove
So live with me
And be my vole
Vole ? Hang on
Where you could be my pet
My dove
Live with me
And be my ... vole
Hang on , that can't be right
We're having a lovely time , wish you were here
We're having a lovely time , wish you were here
There's miles of frankfurters and people who hurt us in Germany
We haven't played since yesterday
There's just ten more shows and one week to go
We'd all like to go
We're having a lovely time , wish you were here
We're having a lovely time , wish you were here
Great piles of spaghetti , bad vibes like confetti in Italy
We go by train and not by plane
We'd come home by car if it wasn't too far
To drive home by car
Hope you're well at home
Next week I'll try to phone
Not very long to go
I'll tell you when I'm coming home as soon as I know
We're having a lovely time , wish you were here
We're having a lovely time , wish you were here
There's lots of French fries , disapproving eyes in the U.S.A
We've had no shows since I don't know
There's just one thing wrong , we've been here too long
The money's all gone
We're having a lovely time , wish you were here
We're having a lovely time , wish you were here
There's kangaroos and we're bad news in Australia
Thrown off the plane for drinking beer
So long on the plane it drove us insane
So long on the plane
Hope you're well at home
Next week I'll try to phone
Not very long to go
I'll tell you when I'm coming home as soon as I know
We're having a lovely time , wish you were here
We're having a lovely time , wish you were here
We've done very well , but we've been to hell
And heaven as well
There once was a note pure and easy
Playing so free like a breath rippling by
The note is eternal , I hear it it sees me
Forever we blend and forever we die
I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star
As people assemble civilization
Is trying to find a new way to die
But killing is really merely scene changer
All men are bored with other men's lives
I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star
Gas on the hillside , oil in the teacup
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy
Distortion becomes somehow pure in its wildness
The note that began all can also destroy
We all know success when we all find our own dreams
And our love is enough to knock down any walls
And the future's been seen as men try to realize
The simple secret of the note in us all
I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star
There once was a note pure and easy
Playing so free like a breath rippling by
There once was a note , listen
There once was a note , listen
There once was a note , listen
There once was a note , listen
There once was a note , listen
There once was a note , listen
There once was a note , listen
There once was a note , listen
There once was a note pure and easy
Playing so free like a breath rippling by
The note is eternal , I hear it , it sees me
Forever we blend and forever we die
I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star
As people assemble , civilization
Is trying to find a new way to die
But killing is really merely scene changer
All men are bored with other men's lives
I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star
Gas on a hillside , oil in a teacup
Watch all the chords of life lose their joy
Distortion becomes somehow pure in its wildness
The note that began all can also destroy
We all know success when we all find our own dreams
And our love is enough to knock down any walls
And the future's been seen as men try to realize
The simple secret of the note in us all
In us all
I listened and I heard music in a word
And words when you played your guitar
The noise that I was hearing was a million people cheering
And a child flew past me riding in a star
Listen
Listen
There once was a note Listen
There once was a note Listen
There once was a note Listen
There once was a note Listen
There once was a note Listen
There once was a note Listen
There once was a note Listen
There once was a note Listen
There once was a note Listen
There once was a note Listen
There once was a note Listen
There once was a note Listen
There once was a note Listen
There once was a note Listen
There once was a note Listen
I got lost in the backstreets
Trying to get here tonight
The police were asking questions
They took me to the wrong place twice
I even lost my passport
And I forgot my name and town
But now I'm here by the water
Put the money down
Before I walk on the water
Put the money down , down , down
There are bands killing chickens
My hero's getting pushed around , 'round , 'round
I don't know if I trust you
As you try to shoot me down
Before I walk on the water
Put the money down , down , down
Put the money down !
'Twas a beautiful day in Columbus when the fences fell
But the five loaves and the fishes ain't gonna be much help
I got a hungry juggler here who wants to keep ahead
Before he walks the water he wants his bread !
Take a glass of the dark brown ale
And a purple pill
If the ale don't get you too
You sure as hell the pill will
Oh mommy , mommy , please may I go downtown ?
He's gonna walk on the water
Put the money down
Put it down !
In a tin cup !
The Red Chins in their millions
Will overspill their borders
And chaos then will reign in our Rael
The country of my fathers
A proud land of old order
Like a goldfish being swallowed by a whale
Rael , the home of my religion
To me the center of the Earth
The Red Chins in their millions
Will overspill their borders
And chaos then will reign in our Rael
My heritage is threatened
My roots are torn and cornered
And so to do my best I'll homeward sail
And so to do my best I'll homeward sail
Now Captain , listen to my instructions
Return to this spot on Christmas Day
Look toward the shore for my signal
And then you'll know if in Rael I'll stay
If a yellow flag is fluttering
Sickly herald against the morn
Then you'll know my courage has ended
And you'll send your boat ashore
But if a red flag is flying
Brazen bold against the blue
Then you'll know that I am staying
And my yacht belongs to you
Now Captain , listen to my instructions
Return to this spot on Christmas Day
Look toward the shore for my signal
And then you'll know if in Rael I'll stay
He's crazy if he thinks we're coming back again
He's crazy , anyway
If a yellow flag is fluttering
Sickly herald against the morn
Then you'll know my courage has ended
And you'll send your boat ashore
The Red Chins in their millions
Will overspill their borders
And chaos then will reign in our Rael
The country of my fathers
A proud land of old order
Like a goldfish being swallowed by a whale
Rael , the home of my religion
To me the center of the Earth
The Red Chins in their millions
Will overspill their borders
And chaos then will reign in our Rael

And so to do my best I'll homeward sail

What I see is all I've seen
In my sweetest sleep in dreams
What I feel is all I've felt
When by newborn babes I've knelt
What I know now is all I've known
That has been good while I have grown
Bless the thoughts that made me sail
And the God who made Rael
...
When I think back to the first time in my childhood
When I saw that face I thought right then
That's a real good looking boy
I saw myself in the mirror
In profile for the first time I thought , Hey !
That's a real good looking boy
And I felt then that I moved
With all those lucky fucks and angels
High in the theatre in the sky
So I went to my mother I said
Hey mom , take look at me
Have you ever seen a teen fly so high ?
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
She said , Son , well , you know
You're an ugly boy
You don't really look like him
In this long line there's been some
Real strange genes
You got 'em all , you got 'em all
With some extras thrown in
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
Wise men say
Only fools , only fools rush in
But I , I can't help
Falling in love , in love with you
Now I'm here with you little darling
And you say , You're beautiful as you are
And I've managed somehow to survive
You arrived in my life like a fragrance
You helped me find a way to laugh
And now I know how so-called beauty lies
God gave him a face
Then he gave me something above
God gave me grace
Then he gave me your sweet , sweet , sweet love
You make me feel like a real good looking boy
I feel like a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
When I think back to the first time in my childhood
When I saw that face , I thought right then
That's a real good looking boy
I saw myself in the mirror in profile
For the first time , I thought
Hey , that's a real good looking boy
And I felt then that I moved
With all those lucky and angels
High in the theater in the sky
So I ran to my mother
I said , Hey Mom , take a look at me
Have you ever seen a teen fly so high?
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
She said , Son , well you know you're an ugly boy
You don't really look like him
In this long line , there's been some real strange genes
You got 'em all , you got 'em all with some extras thrown in
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
Wise men say
Only fools , only fools rush in
But I , I can't help
Falling in love , in love with you
Now I'm here with you , little darling
And you say , You're beautiful as you are
And I've managed somehow to survive
You arrived in my life like a fragrance
You helped me find a way to laugh
Now I know how so called beauty lies
God gave him a face
Then he gave me something above
God gave me a grace
Then he gave me your sweet , sweet , sweet love
You make me feel I'm a real good looking boy
I feel I'm a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
That's a real good looking boy
Relax and settle down
Let your mind go round
Lay down on the ground
And listen to the sound
Of the band
Hold my hand
Open up your mind
We'll love right where we lie
I'll know you from inside
You're like a horse I'll ride
O'er the sand
Through the land
Relax and let your mind roll on
Over all your problems
Relax and let your mind roll on
Over all your problems
We try harder and harder , trying to get our way
But it's a long , long wait until Judgement Day
So settle your affairs and take your time
Because everything in the world is yours and mine
Yours and mine
Relax!
You can hear it in the street
See it in the dragging feet
The word is getting out about control
Spies , they've come and gone
The story travels on
The only quiet place is inside your soul
From tree to tree
From you to me
Traveling twice as fast as on any freeway
Every single dream
Wrapped up in the scheme
They all get carried on the relay
The relay Things are brewing
The relay Something's doin'
The relay There's a revolution
The relay , relay Hand me down a solution !
Yeah , pass it on !
Keep on , relay !
Someone disapproves
Of what you say and do
I was asked to see what I could really learn you
Don't believe your eyes
You're telling only lies
What is done in the first place don't concern you
From tree to tree
From you to me
Traveling twice as fast as on any freeway
Every single dream
Wrapped up in the scheme
They all get carried on the relay
The relay Things are brewing
The relay Something's doin'
The relay There's a revolution
The relay , relay Hand me down a solution !
Yeah , pass it on
Pass it on
Pass it on !
Hey you ! Pass it on
We're on the relay !
Get a-movin'
Get on a-movin' on
The relay , the relay
The relay , the relay...
You can hear it in the street
See it in the dragging feet
The word is getting out about control
Spies they're come and gone
The story travels on
The only quiet place is inside your soul
From tree to tree
From you to me
Traveling twice as fast as on any freeway
Every single dream
Is wrapped up in the scheme
They all get carried on the relay
Pass it on
Someone disapproves
Of what you say or do
I was asked to see what I could really learn you
Don't believe your eyes
They're seeing only lies
What is done in the first place don't concern you
From tree to tree
From you to me
Traveling twice as fast as on any freeway
Every single dream
Is wrapped up in the scheme
They all get carried on the relay
Relay , things are brewing
Relay , something's doin'
Relay , it's a revolution
Relay , relay
Hand me down a solution !
Pass it on
If I can't speak my truth for fear of bein' abused
I might as well be a mute , my voice never used
I'll be maligned , I'll be dissed and then trolled
If I can't be aligned , I'll be thrown in the cold
I don't think I've ever felt so out on the margin
I'm too old to fight the machetes and blades
I feel like a leper , like handin' my cards in
Like I don't have the right to join the parades
I'm rockin' in rage , forward and back
My bones disengage , they splinter and crack
Defying the clock in one last rampage
Drop all the lines , I'm rockin' in rage
Rockin' in rage , oh , I won't leave the stage
Oh yeah , I'm rockin' in rage
If you can write it right here , you know how to die
If you can conquer your fear , you'll get to fly
Ooh , you'll get to fly
This must be your right , to get it down on the page
You know you must write , you know you must rage
You might learn to fly , get out on the stage
But you might as well lie , unless you can rage
I don't think I've ever felt so out on the margin
I'm too old to fight the machetes and blades
I feel like a leper , like handin' my cards in
Like I don't have the right to join the parades
I'm rockin' in rage , well past my prime
Denyin' the curtain , wastin' no time
So this is the carver , the death before age
I thought I'd be calm , but I'm rockin' in rage
Rockin' in rage , ooh , I won't leave the stage
I'm rockin' in rage , rockin' in rage
Rockin' in rage , no , I won't leave the stage
'Cause I'm a-rockin' in rage
No , no , no , ooh , I won't leave the stage
If I can't speak my truth for fear of being abused
Might as well be a mute , my voice never used
This must be my right , get it down on the page
I know I must write , I know I must rage
Rage
Rage
Hold your group together
With Rotosound strings
Tough boys
Running the streets
Come a little closer
Rough toys
Under the sheets
Nobody knows her
Rough boys
Don't walk away
I very nearly missed you
Tough boys
Come over here
I wanna bite and kiss you
I wanna see what I can find
Tough kids
Take a bottle of wine
When your deal is broken
Ten quid
She's so easy to find
Not a word is spoken
Rough boys
Don't walk away
I'm still pretty blissed here
Tough boy
I'm gonna carry you home
You got pretty pissed dear
Gonna get inside you
Gonna get inside your bitter mind
Rough boys
Don't walk away
I wanna buy you leather
Make noise
Try and talk me away
We can't be seen together
Tough kids
What can I do ?
I'm so pale and weedy
Rough fits
In my Hush Puppy shoes
But I'm still pleading
Tough boys
Running the streets
Come a little closer
Rough toys
Under the sheets
Nobody knows her
Rough boys
Don't walk away
I very nearly missed you
Tough boys
Come over here
I wanna bite and kiss you
I wanna see what I can find!
Run , run , run
Well baby , better take my advice
A black cat crossed your path twice
The moon came out next to the sun
Then you opened your umbrella in a room
You better run , run , run
Run , run , run
Well you ain't the luckiest girl I know
And you won't get luckier the way you're going
Your horseshoe's rusty and your mirror's cracked
You walk under ladders then you walk right back
When you dropped that little pin
Never thought what a mess it would get you in
Little pin , little pin , bring me luck
Because I stopped to pick you up
Well now , little girl , I'm helping you
I hope you believe what I say is true
Whenever you run , I'll be running too
Whenever you run , I'll be following you
Run , run , run

KEITH MOON :

RUSSELL HARTY :
I think you'll have to give me a few lessons in survival
Outside the house Mr . Simpson announced
That Sally couldn't go to the meeting
He went on cleaning his blue Rolls Royce
And she ran inside weeping
She got to her room and tears splashed the picture
Of the new Messiah
She picked up a book of her father's life
And threw it on the fire !
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her Mother said never mind your part
Is to be what you'll be
The theme of the sermon was come unto me
Love will find a way
So Sally decided to ignore her dad
And sneak out anyway
She spent all afternoon getting ready
And decided she'd try to touch him
Maybe he'd see that she was free
And talk to her this Sunday
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her Mother said never mind your part
Is to be what you'll be
She arrived at six and the place was swinging
To gospel music by nine
Group after group appeared on the stage
And Sally just sat there crying
She bit her nails looking pretty as a picture
Right in the very front row
And then a DJ wearing a blazer with a badge
Ran on and said here we go !
The crowd went crazy
As Tommy hit the stage
Little Sally got lost as the police bossed
The crowd back in a rage
But soon the atmosphere was cooler
And Tommy gave a lesson
Sally just had to let him know she loved him
And leapt up on the rostrum
She ran cross stage to the spotlit figure
And brushed him on the face
Tommy whirled around as a uniformed man
Threw her off the stage
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her Mother said never mind your part
Is to be what you'll be
Her cheek hit a chair and blood trickled down
Mingling with her tears
Tommy carried on preaching
And his voice filled Sally's ears
She caught his eye she had to try
But he couldn't see through the lights
Her face was gashed and the ambulance men
Had to carry her out that night
The crowd went crazy
As Tommy left the stage
Little Sally was lost for the price of a touch
And a gash across her face ! Oh !
Sixteen stitches put her right and her Dad said
Don't say I didn't warn yer
Sally got married to a rock musician
She met in California
Tommy always talks about the day
The disciples all went wild !
Sally still carries a scar on her cheek
To remind her of his smile
She knew from the start
Deep down in her heart
That she and Tommy were worlds apart
But her Mother said never mind your part
Is to be what you'll be

You take me down to the beach that your father rows in Spain
I run my hands through the pure golden sand and watch you fall like rain
And then we run on the yellow liquid acres to the ocean grand
I love you madly but our love is only built on sand
It's seldom(? and it's warm
It shines in the dawn
But the castles that you planned
Will crumble in your hand
When you build them on
Sand
Sand
Sand
Sand
Now the sand is in my shoes and I can't walk
It's in my ears and in my eyes and I can't see or talk
All the letters that I wrote in the sand are now washed to other lands
I still love you but our love was only built on sand
Wе could have alot of fun
Building castles in the sun
Your drеams get down to suss(?
When you get sand in your eyes
Sand
Sand
Sand
Sand
All the letters that I wrote in the sand are now washed to other lands
I still love you but our love was only built on sand
We could have alot of fun
Building castles in the sun
Your dreams get down to suss(?
When you get sand in your eyes
Sand
Sand
Sand
Sand
Agitating
Irritating
Oh how I hate this sand
Sand
Sand
Sand
Sand
It's getting late , have you seen my mates ?
Go on , tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock
I want to get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady , she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
And a handful of grease in her hair
Hey , don't give us none of your aggravation
We've had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting , get a little action in
I get about as oiled as a diesel train , gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright , alright , alright
Well , they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
And I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
And sink a little drink and shout , She's with me!
A couple of the sounds that I really like
Are the sound of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass
But don't , don't give us none of your aggravation , we've had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting , to get a little action in
I get about as oiled as a diesel train , gonna set this dance alight
Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright , alright , alright
Saturday night's alright , alright , alright
Saturday , Saturday , Saturday !
Saturday , Saturday , Saturday !
Saturday , Saturday , Saturday !
Saturday , Saturday !
Take me to the pilot , lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot , I am but a stranger
Take me to the pilot , lead me through the chamber
Take me to the pilot , I am but a stranger
Na na na , na na na
Na na na , na na na na na
Na na na , na na na
Na na na , na na na na na
Ooh yeah !
Saturday , Saturday !
Saturday , Saturday !
Saturday , Saturday !
Saturday , Saturday !
I can't wait for Saturday !
Saturday , Saturday , Saturday !
Saturday , Saturday , Saturday !
Saturday , Saturday , Saturday !
Saturday , Saturday , Saturday !
I can't wait for Saturday night night night night night
Here by the sea and sand
Nothing ever goes as planned
I just couldn't face going home
It was just a drag on my own
They finally threw me out
My mum got drunk on stout
My dad couldn't stand on two feet
As he lectured about morality
And now I guess the family's complete
With me hanging round on the street
Or here on the beach
The girl I love is a perfect dresser
Wears every fashion , gets it to the tee
Heavens above , I've got to match her
She knows just how she wants her man to be
Leave it to me
My jacket's going to be cut slim and checked
Maybe a touch of seersucker with an open neck
I ride a GS scooter with my hair cut neat
I wear my wartime coat in the wind and sleet
I see her dance across the ballroom
UV light making star-shine of her smile
I am the Face , she has to know me
I'm dressed up better than anyone within a mile
So how come the other tickets look much better ?
Without a penny to spend they dress to the letter
How come the girls come on , oh so cool
Yet when you meet them , everyone's a fool ?
Come sleep on the beach
Keep within my reach
I just want to die with you here
I'm feeling so high with you here
I'm wet and I'm cold
But thank God I ain't old
Why didn't I say what I mean ?
I should have split home at fifteen
There's a story that the grass is so green
What did I see ? Where have I been ?
Nothing is planned by the sea and the sand
I'm the Face if you want it

Some way , some day , I'll find a way
To make you see my way
Even if you don't think like I do
You know that it's true
It's your mind that I seek
Tried so hard to make me think my point of view was bad
Although at times when you kept on I thought that I was mad
I'm glad it's goodbye
You don't have to ask why
Come back another day
Come back when you see my way
You see my way
Tried so hard to make me think my point of view was bad
Although at times when you kept on I thought that I was mad
Some way , some day , I'll find a way
To make you see my way
I'm glad it's goodbye
You don't have to ask why
Come back another day
Come back when you see my way
You see my way
You see my way
I overwhelm as I approach you
Make your lungs hold breath inside !
Lovers break caresses for me
Love enhanced when I've gone by
You'll feel me coming
A new vibration
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation
I'm a sensation
They worship me and all I touch
Hazy eyed they catch my glance
Pleasant shudders shake their senses
My warm momentum throws their stance
You'll feel me coming
A new vibration
From afar you'll see me
I'm a sensation
I'm a sensation
Soon you'll see me , can't you feel me
I'm coming
Send your troubles dancing , I know the answer
I'm coming
I'm coming
I'm a sensation
I leave a trail of rooted people
Mesmerized by just the sight
The few I touched now are disciples
Love as One , I Am the Light
I overwhelm as I approach you
Make your lungs hold breath inside !
Lovers break caresses for me
Love enhanced when I've gone by
You'll feel me coming

From afar you'll see me

The few I touched now are disciples
Love as One I Am the Light
When you move in right up close to me
That's when I get the shakes all over me
Quivers down my backbone
I got the shakes in the knee bones
Quivers in my thigh bones
Like I'm
Shakin' all over
That's what happens when you say goodnight to me
Bring this feeling all inside of me
Quivers down my backbone

Shivers in the thigh bones

B . Spoonful
It could be a spoonful of diamond
It could be a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Satisfy my soul
Men lies about little
Some of them cries about little
Some of them dies about littles
Everything fight about a spoonful
That spoon , That spoon , that

Places ring bells
Faces all wrong
Old town's the same
But old friends are gone
We raised some hell
The night can still call
Who was that girl pressed up against the wall ?
You hear people say
She rocked my world
They don't mean it the way I do
They seem to demean it
Like some dumb cliché
But for that certain girl , it's totally true
She rocked my world
She rocked my world
Blew me down
Rocked my world and turned me 'round
Rocked my world
Amazing girl
Ooh , yes , she rocked my world
Hmm , amazing girl
She served the beer down at the Dome
Working the nights
Teen daughter at home
We made it once , just like a game
Then out of my sights
But I remember her name
Just wanna be gone , no denial of pain
Don't want to remember , but it rolls back again
Can't make it softer , can't make it stop
Unending while till I hit the top
She rocked my world
Rocked my world
And blew me down
Rocked my world
Woo , she spun me 'round
Rocked my world
Ooh , amazing girl
She rocked my world
Ooh , she rocked my world
Yes , she rocked my world
Places ring bells
Faces all wrong
Old town's the same
But old friends are gone
We raised some hell
The night can still call
Who was that girl pressed up against the wall?
Do you feel alright ?
Well do you feel alright children ?
Do you feel alright ?
You know you make me want to shout shimmy
Oh yeah you gonna shout shimmy
Oh yeah you gonna shout shimmy
Oh yeah you gonna shout shimmy
Oh yeah you know I walk up to the front , I try to do the flop
I walk up to the back , and I move on side to side
Then I stop , oh yeah and then I drop
Oh yeah and then I drop
Oh yeah and then I do a little thing I never did before
Do you feel alright ? Do you feel so good ? Do you feel so good ?
Do you feel alright ? Do you feel alright ? Tell me now , tell me now
Do you feel alright ? Do you feel alright ?
Everybody do you feel so good ? You know I feel alright
Yyou know you make me want to shout shimmy

Shout a little bit soft , come on soft , shout a little bit soft

Everybody everybody everybody clap your hands , come on clap your hands
Clap your hands , a little bit harder , a little bit louder

Once upon a time there lived an old miser man
By the name of Silas Stingy
He carried all his money in a little black box
Which was heavy as a rock
With a big padlock
All the little kids would shout
When Silas was about
Money , money , money bags
Money , money , money bags
There goes mingy Stingy
There goes mingy Stingy
Money , money , money bags
Money , money , money bags
There goes mingy Stingy
There goes mingy Stingy
Silas didn't eat , which was just as well
He would starve himself for a penny
He wore old clothes and he never washed
Because soap cost a lot
And the dirt kept him hot
All the little kids would shout
When Silas was about
In the back of his head
Was a voice that said
Someone will steal it all
You'll be lying in the gutter with an empty box
The thieves will be having a ball
He bought a safe to put the box in
And a house to put the safe in
And a watchdog on a chain to make quite sure
And his face was very funny
When he counted up his money
And he realized he hadn't any more
I remember when you told me what you're all about
And I remember I decided not to spare a doubt
Started to trust you
I would lust you , never even cared to cuss you
Plant a seed next to a mushroom , and a flower sprout
Cartoon , I would chase you like a cat and mouse
Harpoon , got me hooked , my lips to your mouth
Sing out to the moon , sunset blue and maroon
While me and you played through some tunes back at my momma's house
Legs so perfect , way you work it in that fine blouse
Open the curtains , see you working singing Winehouse
But it's for certain , I don't have no need for searchin'
You're right here , and you're in person
I got nothin' more to whine about
Daydreamin' while I'm thinking of you , yeah
Sweet memories while the sky was blue
I'm just , daydreamin while I'm thinking of you , yeah
I'm just , I'm just , I'm just thinking of you
Thinking of you
I'm just , I'm just , I'm just thinking of you
Thinking of you
You've been hella' trusting
You can take the front seat
Hop up on my aux and play some oldies we can all sing
Bumpin' it like all spring
Nah this ain't no fall fling
Every time you hit my line I follow with a call ring
We can run it back
Just lay down and relax
Lay down my life for you , you'll be my Rose and I'll be Jack
When you're blue , when you're black
I got you , that's a fact
Just come through and we'll crack , a few brews out the back
Give you everything you lack
Rolled some love up in this pack
Drinkin by the fire sipping Miller like I'm Mac
Serenity in memory , wrote this to bring you back
And if you didn't get my message , hit the rewind on this track
As I walked through that hospital door
I was sewn up like a coat
I got a smile from the bite of the wind
Watched the fresh fall of snow
I knew then that my life took a turn
I felt strong and secure
And with adhesive tape over my nose
I felt almost demure
Goodbye Sister Disco
With your flashing trash lamps
Goodbye Sister Disco
And to your clubs and your tramps
Goodbye Sister Disco
My dancing's left you behind
Goodbye , now you're solo
Black plastic; deaf , dumb and blind
Bye , goodbye Sister Disco , now I go
I go where the music fits my soul
And I , I will never let go , I'll never let go
'Til the echo of the street fight has dissolved
I will choose nightmares and cold stormy seas
I will take over your grief and disease
I'll stay beside you and comfort your soul
When you are lonely and broken and old
Now I walk with a man in my face
Ooh , a woman in my hair
I've got you all looking out though my eyes
My feet are a prayer
One , two , three , four
Five , six , stay intact
I've got my clipboard , textbooks
Lead me to the station
Yeah , I'm off to the civil war
I've got my kit bag , my heavy boots
I'm running in the rain
Going to run 'til my feet are raw
Slip kid , slip kid , second generation
I'm a soldier at thirteen
Slip kid , slip kid , realization
There's no easy way to be free
No easy way to be free
It's a hard , hard world
I left my doctor's prescription
Bungalow behind me
I left the door ajar
I left my vacuum flask
Full of hot tea and sugar
Left the keys right in my car
Slip kid , slip kid , second generation
Only half way up the tree
Slip kid , slip kid , I'm a relation
I'm a soldier at sixty-three
No easy way to be free
Slip kid , slip kid
Keep away , old man Slip kid
You won't fool me
You and your history Slip kid
Won't rule me
You might've been a fighter Slip kid
But admit you failed
I'm not affected by your blackmail
You won't blackmail me
I've got my clipboard , textbooks
Lead me to the station
Yeah , I'm off to the civil war
I've got my kit bag , my heavy boots
I'm running in the rain
Going to run 'til my feet are raw
Slip kid , slip kid , slip out of trouble
Slip over here and set me free
Slip kid , slip kid , second generation
You're sliding down the hill like me
No easy way to be free
No easy way to be free
No easy way to be free
No easy way to be free
No easy way to be free
No easy way to be free...
You don't answer my call
With even a nod or a wink
But you gaze at your own reflection !
You don't seem to see me
But I think you can see yourself
How can the mirror affect you ?
Can you hear me
Or do I surmise ?
That you fear me , can you feel my temper
RISE
Do you hear or fear or
Do I smash the mirror
Do you hear of fear or
Do I smash the mirror ? SMASH!
You don't answer my call

But you gaze at your own reflection !
You don't seem to see me

How can the mirror affect you ?
Can you hear me
Or do I surmise ?
That you fear me , can you feel my temper
RISE
Do you hear or fear or
Do I smash the mirror
Do you hear of fear or
Do I smash the mirror ? SMASH!
I stood at the door beside her
But she would not let me pass
I was such a boor and I lied to her
I said I did not really want her ass
I went away in the mud and rain
The gang became snide and laughed
I was slayed but I smiled and the pain
Began to subside at last
And when I got back to my hotel
I wondered if the thunder meant I would landed in hell
And on the forecourt I slipped and fell
I cracked my stupid head and I heard a bell
I thought Hey!
Somebody saved me , it happened again
Somebody saved me , I thank you my friend
Somebody saved me , from a fate worse than heaven
Cause if I would had her for just an hour
I would have wanted her forever
Somebody saved me
You would have thought that I would have learned
Twenty years ago or more
A beautiful girl raised her mouth and yearned
But I did not know what lips were for
I ran away in the mud and rain
The weather here is never too bright
She would had an affray with her man and came
For solace and the means to fight
She finally bored with seducing me
And took up with some geezer from the Eagling scene
And it nearly killed him like it would have killed me
When her original man snapped his fingers and she obeyed
She obeyed
I do not know about guardian angels
All I know about's staying alive
I cannot shout about spiritual labels
When little ones die and big ones thrive
All I know is that I have been making it
There have been times I did not deserve to
Every show there's been more faking it
But right at the point of no return
Somebody saves me , and it happened again
Somebody saves me , and I thank you my friend
Somebody saves me , from a fate worse than heaven
Cause if I blew it for a single moment
I would blow it forever
But somebody saves me
I took up the connection once
Made me feel quite aloof
I never could queue to collect my lunch
While I was pursuing the truth
I left my folks in the mud and rain
It always rained in Sunnyside Road
I lived hippie jokes getting stoned insane
'Til the rain looked just like snow
But there was a soul in whom I could depend
He worked himself crazy while I laid in bed
I never leaned on a person like I leaned right then
And when I finally woke up clean
My friend was dead , stone dead
But somebody saved me , it happened again
Somebody saved me , I thank you my friend
Somebody saved me , I am not ready for heaven
Cause if I would seen you for a second , I would have wanted to see you forever
Somebody saved me
Goodnight , baby
Someone's a-coming , someone's a-coming
Goodnight , baby
Gotta get a-running , gotta get a-running
Your father doesn't like me
Told you that you couldn't see me any more
That's why we meet in secret
That's why we're hiding here
Goodnight , baby
Same time tomorrow , same time tomorrow
Goodnight , baby
See you here tomorrow , see you here tomorrow
Your mother made you stay in
When she saw you going out with me
You'll say you'll take the dog out
Then you sneak out here to me
If your parents find you here
You're gonna get a-hiding , gonna get a-hiding
So I'll vanish , disappear
See you here tomorrow , see you here tomorrow

So sad about us
So sad about us
Sad that the news is out now
Sad , suppose we can't turn back now
Sad about us
So bad about us
So bad about us
Bad - never meant to break up
Bad - suppose we'll never make up
Bad about us
Apologies mean nothing
When the damage is done
But I can't switch off my loving
Like you can't switch off the sun

I'm young in my camper van
The world feels old and new
I fear the future man
As I take in the view
Don't know where to head now
Give up ? Go back ?
My friends are all dead now
Or stifled in the sack
Sound round
Feel the ground
Feel the pulse
We have found
Breathe in
Feel the spin
Where's the dream
That we were in ?
Mama's got a squeeze box
She wears on her chest
And when Daddy comes home
He never gets no rest
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
Well the kids don't eat
And the dog can't sleep
There's no escape from the music
In the whole damn street
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
She's playin' all night and the music's all right
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
She goes , squeeze me , come on and squeeze me
Come on and tease me like you do
I'm so in love with you
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
She goes in and out and in and out
And in and out and in and out
'Cause she's playing all night
And the music's alright
Mama's got a squeeze box
Daddy never sleeps at night
I'll kill'em all , you won't go far from here
A shooting star , there out in the white snow
This is who I am , no one can take that from me
I am a star , lighting up the sky so high
What the hell is going on , I'm looking at myself
Lost in translation , lost in desperation
Looking up at the sky so high above , there is nothing there to see
I don't believe in him so why would he believe in me
Why can't you see ? I'm a lost man on a journey ,
trying to find the one , the one who saves me
I need some guidance that won't give up me ,
if I don't give up on you
I'll kill'em all , you won't go far from here
A shooting star , there out in the white snow
This is who I am , no one can take that from me
I am a star , lighting up the sky so high
So high
I am a star , shining bright as fuck upon you
Everyone can see I'm a motherfucking G L L cool J
What did you say ? I am the number one so be humble , be humble
Don't let your death be subtle , I'm humble , bitch
Be someone or be nobody
I'm somebody , create something and be a star ,
that's what you are , If you try then you go far
Leave no scars , run , run away from here
Follow the stars and find your place and prevail , set your sail
Look up at the sky
so high
I'll kill'em all , you won't go far from here
A shooting star , there out in the white snow
This is who I am , no one can take that from me
I am a star , lighting up the sky so high
So high
We ring to say so long
We sing , this is our street song
We ring , so long
We sing , street song
We can sing out anything now
No supremo slows us down
We have banners in the air
We can shout and we can share
We once lacked the strength to wail
Simple fact : we stood to fail
Flames and smoke and searing heat
Then the angel spoke , You own the street
We ring , so long
We ring to say so long
We sing , street song
We sing , this is our street song
We ring , so long
We ring to say so long
We sing , street song
We sing , we sing , this is our street song
We ring , so long

Say goodbye to the ones that I love

Friday night , I'm on my way home
They oughta make work a crime
I'm home for the weekend
I'm going to make the most of my time
There's a rock and roll singer on the television
Giving up his music , gonna take up religion
Deserted rock and roll
To try to save his soul
Saturday night , gotta gig with a band
Playing the electric guitar
Someday I'm going to make it
Going to be a super-duper-star
Get a big flashy car
And a house for my Ma
The big break better happen soon
Because I'm pushing twenty-one
Just like Cinderella
When she couldn't go to the ball
A voice said , I'm your fairy manager
You shall play the Carnegie Hall
I got to give up my day job
To become a heartthrob
I may go far if I smash my guitar
Away for the weekend
I've got to play some one-night stands
Six for the tax man , and one for the band
Back in the studio to make our latest number one
Take two-hundred-and-seventy-six
You know , this used to be fun
Monday morning , I just got home
Six and the birds are singing
I need a drink and my clothes are wet
Oh , and my ears are still ringing
There's a rock and roll singer bopping on the TV
He used to be a preacher , but now he sings in a major key
Amended his decision to the new religion
Well , I'm a gonna raise a fuss , I'm a gonna raise a holler
I've been working all summer just to try and earn a dollar
Well , I went to the boss , said I got a date
The boss said No Dice , son , you gotta work late
Sometimes I wonder , what am I gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Well , my mom and poppa told me , Son you gotta earn some money
If you want to use the car to go out next Sunday
Well , I didn't go to work , I told the boss I was sick
He said You can't use the car cause you didn't work a lick
Sometimes I wonder , what am I gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Gonna take two weeks , gonna have a fine vacation
Gonna take my problems to the United Nations
Well , I went to my congressman , he said , quote
I'd like to help you son but you're too young to vote
Sometimes I wonder , what am I gonna do
There ain't no cure for the summertime blues
Well , I'm a gonna raise a fuss , I'm a gonna raise a holler
I've been working all summer just to try and earn a dollar
Well , I went to the boss , said I got a date
The boss said No Dice , son , you gotta work late

You take away the breath I was keeping for sunrise
You appear and the morning looks drab in my eyes
And then again I'll turn down love
Having seen you again
Once more you'll disappear
My morning put to shame
Sometimes I fear that this will go on my life through
Each day I spend in an echoed vision of you
And then again I'll turn down love
Remembering your smile
My every day is spent
Thinking of you all the while
The times I've let myself down
My head's spinning 'round
My eyes see only you
The chances I've lost
Opportunities tossed
Away and into the blue
You take away the breath I was keeping for sunrise
You appear and the morning looks drab in my eyes
And then again I'll turn down love
Having seen you again
Then again you'll disappear
My morning put to shame
Me and my brother were talking to each other
About what makes a man a man
Was it brain or brawn , or the month you were born
We just couldn't understand
Our old man didn't like our appearance
He said that only women wear long hair
So me and my brother borrowed money from Mother
We knew what we had to do
We went downstairs , past the barber and gymnasium
And got our arms tattooed
Welcome to my life , tattoo
I'm a man now , thanks to you
I expect I'll regret you
But the skin graft man won't get you
You'll be there when I die
Tattoo
My dad beat me because mine said Mother
But my mother naturally liked it and beat my brother
Cause his tattoo was of a lady in the nude
And my mother thought that was extremely rude
Welcome to my life , tattoo
We've a long time together , me and you
Now I'm older , I'm tattooed all over
My wife is tattooed too
A rooty-toot-toot , rooty-tooty-toot-toot
Rooty-toot-toot tattoo too
To you
Jingle bells , jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh , what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells , jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh , what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells , j-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh , what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells , j-j-j-jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh , what a lotta fun , what a lotta fun to ride and sing
In a one horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow we are dashing
In a one horse open sleigh one horse sleigh
O'er the fields we go o'er the fields we go , we go
Laughing all the way all the way
Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight
Jingle bells , jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh , what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh
Jingle bells , jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh , what fun it is to ride

Will you have some tea
At the theatre with me ?
We did it all
Didn't we ?
Jumped every wall
Instinctively
Unravelled codes
Ingeniously
Wired all the roads
So seamlessly
We made it work
But one of us failed
That makes it so sad
A great dream derailed
One of us - gone
One of us - mad
One of us - me
All of us sad
All of us sad
Lean on my shoulder now
This story is done
It's getting colder now
A thousand songs
Still smoulder now
We play them as one
We're older now
All of us sad
All of us free
Before we walk from this stage
Two of us
Will you have some tea
At the theatre with me
If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl could put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night
I'm the gypsy , the acid queen
Pay before we start
I'm the Gypsy , I guarantee
To tear your soul apart
Give us a room , close the door
Leave us for a while
Your boy won't be a boy no more
Young , but not a child
I'm the gypsy , the acid queen
Pay before we start
The gypsy , I'm guaranteed
To tear your soul apart
Gather your wits and hold on fast
Your mind must learn to roam
Just as the gypsy queen must do
You're gonna hit the road
My work is done
Now look at him
He's never been more alive
His head , it shakes
His fingers clutch
Watch his body writhe
I'm the gypsy , the acid queen
Pay before we start
I'm the gypsy , I'm guaranteed
To break your little heart
If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl will put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night
I'm the gypsy , the acid queen
Pay before we start
The gypsy , I'm guaranteed
To tear your soul apart
If your child ain't all he should be now
This girl could put him right
I'll show him what he could be now
Just give me one night
I'm the gypsy , the acid queen
Pay before we start
I'm the Gypsy , I guarantee
To tear your soul apart
Give us a room , close the door
Leave us for a while
Your boy won't be a boy no more
Young , but not a child

Pay before we start
The gypsy , I'm guaranteed
To tear your soul apart
Gather your wits and hold on fast
Your mind must learn to roam
Just as the gypsy queen must do
You're gonna hit the road
My work is done
Now look at him
He's never been more alive
His head , it shakes
His fingers clutch
Watch his body writhe
I'm the gypsy , the acid queen
Pay before we start
I'm the gypsy , I'm guaranteed
To break your little heart

I am a man who looks after the pigs
Usually I get along okay
I am a man who reveals all he digs
Should be more careful what I say
I'm being put down
I'm getting pushed round
I'm being beaten every day
My life's fading
Things are changing
I'm not going to sit and weep again
I am man who drives a local bus
I take miners to work but the pits all closed today
It's easy to see that you are one of us
Isn't it funny how we all seem to look the same
I'm getting put down
I'm getting pushed round
I'm being beaten every day
My life's fading
Things are changing
I'm not going to sit and weep again
My karma tells me
You've been screwed again
If you let them do it to you
You've got yourself to blame
It's you who feels the pain
It's you who takes the shame
I am a young man , I am not done very much
You men should remember how you used to fight
Just like a child I've been seeing only dreams
I'm all mixed up but I know what's right
I'm being put down
I'm getting pushed round
I'm being beaten every day
My life's fading
Things are changing
I'm not going to sit and weep again
I'm not going to weep again
Sit alone and shiver while the other guys are making
Sit and think , sit with drink
Try to roll one but I'm shaking
Everyday the same way , such a drag so bad
I might feel better than I'll love for certain
Think about the girls I could've had
The girls I could've had
It makes me feel so bad when I think about
The girls I could've had
If I'd've had the nerve
I could've had more women than I deserve
Sittin' reminiscing about nights spent alone
Chicks would talk , we'd take a walk
Then I'd get nervous and go home
Evening's lovely with nostalgia , sittin' , drinking , digging sounds
I'll go out on my own , sometimes a friend might come 'round
The girls I could've had
The girls I could've had
It makes me feel so bad
The girls I could've had
If I'd've had the nerve
I could've had more women than I deserve , ah
One week I meet a girl , I wanna make her mine
She's got a pout , I chicken out
Say I'll try another time
Next month I'll travel a hundred miles to see her again
And I do , she's got a boy and a ring , it's the end
Think about the girls I could've had
The girls I could've had
It makes me feel so bad when I think about
The girls I could've had
If I'd've had the nerve
I could've had more women than I deserve
The girls I could've had
The girls I...
The girls , the girls
The girls , the girls
The girls...
I know when I've had enough
When I think your love is rough
The good's gone
The good's gone out of our love
I know it's wrong
We should enjoy it , but
The good's gone
Once we used to get along
Now , each time we kiss , it's wrong
Now it ain't no fun
And the good's gone now
We used to love as one
But we have forgotten now
Yeah , you know it's gone
It's gone forever
I don't mind
Other guys dancing with my girl
That's fine
I know them all pretty well
But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright
Sometimes
I feel I got to get away
Bells chime
I know I got to get away
And I know if I don't , I'll go out of my mind
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright
I know if I go , things would be a lot better for her
I had things planned , but her folks wouldn't let her
I don't mind
Other guys dancing with my girl
That's fine
I know them all pretty well
But I know sometimes I must get out in the light
Better leave her behind
With the kids they're alright
The kids are alright

Well I told you once and I told you twice
You never listen to my advice
You don't try very hard to please me
With what you know it should be easy
Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know , oh no , oh no
Well , I'm sorry girl but I can't stay
Feelin' like I do today
It's too much pain and too much sorrow
How good , I'll feel the same tomorrow
Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know , oh no , oh no
Yeah , c'mon tell
Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know , oh no , oh no
Well I told you once and I told you twice
You never listen to my advice
And here's a chance to change your mind
'Cuz I'll be gone a long , long time
Well this could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know , oh no , oh no
This time baby , I'll see you no more
Last time baby , I'll see you no more
This time baby , I'll see you no more
Last time baby , I'll see you no more
Alright , c'mon , c'mon
You declared you would be three inches taller
You only became what we made you
Thought you were chasing a destiny calling
You only earned what we gave you
You fell and cried as our people were starving
Now you know that we blame you
You tried to walk on the trail we were carving
Now you know that we framed you
I'm the guy in the sky
Flying high , flashing eyes
No surprise I told lies
I'm the punk in the gutter
I'm the new president
And I grew and I bent
Don't you know
Don't it show
I'm the punk with the stutter
My my my my my mmmm my my my
GGGGG-g-g-g-g generation
We tried to speak between lines of oration
You could only repeat what we told you
Your axe belongs to a dying nation
They don't know that we own you
You're watching movies trying to find the feelers
You only see what we show you
We're the slaves of the phony leaders
Breathe the air we have blown you
I'm the guy in the sky
Flying high , flashing eyes
No surprise I told lies
I'm the punk in the gutter
I'm the new president
And I grew and I bent
Don't you know
Don't it show
I'm the punk with the stutter
My my my my my mmmm my my my
GGGGG-g-g-g-g generation
I have to be careful not to preach
I can't pretend that I can teach
And yet I lived your future out
By pounding stages like a clown
And on the dance floor broken glass
And bloody faces slowly pass
The numbered seats in empty rows
It all belongs to me you know
You declared you would be three inches taller
You only became what we made you
Thought you were chasing a destiny calling
You only earned what we gave you
You fell and cried as our people were starving
Now you know that we blame you
You tried to walk on the trail we were carving
Now you know that we framed you
I'm the guy in the sky
Flying high , flashing eyes
No surprise I told lies
I'm the punk in the gutter
I'm the new president
And I grew and I bent
Don't you know
Don't it show
I'm the punk with the stutter
My my my my my mmmm my my my
GGGGG-g-g-g-g generation
Everybody calls me the quiet one
You can see but you can't hear me
Everybody calls me the quiet one
You can try but you can't get near me
I ain't never ever had the gift of gab
But I can talk with my eyes
Words fail me but you won't nail me
My eyes can tell you lies
Still waters run deep so be careful I don't drown you
You've got nothing to hear I've got nothing to say
Sticks and stones may break your bones
But names can never down you
It only takes two words to blow you away
Everybody calls me the quiet one
But you just don't understand
You can listen you won't hear me
With your head stuck in the sand
I ain't never had time for words that don't rhyme
My head is in a cloud
I ain't quiet - everybody else is too loud
Still waters run deep so be careful I don't drown you
You've got nothing to hear I've got nothing to say
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But names can never down you
It only takes two words to blow you away
I went back to the doctor
To get another shrink
I sit and tell him about my weekend
But he never betrays what he thinks
Can you see the real me , doctor , doctor ?
Can you see the real me , doctor ?
Oh , doctor
I went back to my mother
I said , I'm crazy Ma help me
She said , I know how it feels , son
'Cause it runs in the family
Can you see the real me , mother , mother ?
Can you see the real me , mother ?
Oh , mama
Can you see
Can you see
Can you see the real me ?
Can you see
Can you see the real me ?
The real me , the real me
The cracks between the paving stones
Like rivers of flowing veins
Strange people who know me
Peeping from behind every window pane
The girl I used to love
Lives in this yellow house
Yesterday she passed me by
She doesn't want to know me now
Can you see the real me , can you , can you ?
Can you see the real me , can you ?
Oh yes
I ended up with the preacher
Full of lies and hate
I seemed to scare him a little
So he showed me to the golden gate
Can you see the real me , preacher , preacher ?
Can you see the real me , preacher ?
Can you see , can you see , can you see
Can you see the real me doctor
Can you see the real me mother
Can you see the real me me me me me...

I looked under chairs
I looked under tables
I'm tryin to find the key
To fifty million fables
They call me the seeker
I been searchin' low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
I asked Bobby Dylan
I asked The Beatles
I asked Timothy Leary
But he couldn't help me either
They call me the seeker
I been searchin' low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
People tend to hate me 'cause I never smile
As I ransack their homes , they want to shake my hand
Focusing on nowhere , investigating miles
I'm a seeker , I'm a really desperate man
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
I learned how to raise my voice in anger
Yeah , but look at my face; ain't this a smile ?
I'm happy when life's good , and when it's bad , I cry
I got values , but I don't know how or why
I'm looking for me
You're looking for you
We're looking at each other
And we don't know what to do
They call me the seeker
I been searchin' low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
I looked under chairs
I looked under tables
I'm tryin to find the key
To fifty million fables
They call me the seeker
I been searchin low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die

I asked The Beatles
I asked Timothy Leary
But he couldn't help me either
They call me the seeker
I been searchin low and high
I won't get to get what I'm after

People tend to hate me
Because I never smile
As I ransack their homes
They want to shake my hand
Focusing on nowhere
Investigating miles
I'm a seeker
I'm a really desperate man
I won't get to get what I'm after
Till the day I die
I learned how to raise my voice in anger
Yeah but look at my face ain't this a smile
I'm happy when life's good and when it's bad I cry
I got values but I don't know how or why

We're looking at each other
And we don't know what to do

I been searchin low and high

Till the day I die
The song is over
It's all behind me
I should have known it
She tried to find me
Our love is over
They're all ahead now
I've got to learn it
I'm gonna sing out
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains
I'll sing my song to the free , to the free
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains
I'll sing my song to the free , to the free
When I walked in through the door
Thought it was me I was looking for
She was the first song I ever sang
But it stopped as soon as it began
Our love is over
It's all behind me
They're all ahead now
Can't hope to find me
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains
I'll sing my song to the free , to the free
I'll sing my song to the wide open spaces
I'll sing my heart out to the infinite sea
I'll sing my visions to the sky high mountains
I'll sing my song to the free , to the free
The song is over
I'm left with only tears
I must remember
Even if it takes a million years
The song is over
The song is over
Excepting one note , pure and easy
Playing so free , like a breath rippling by
Where do you walk on sunny times
When the rivers gleam and the buildings shine
How do you feel going up hallowed halls
And the summer clothes brighten gloomy halls
And they're all in love
Where do you fit in zzzzip magazine
Where the past is the hero and the present a queen
Just tell me right now where do you fit in
With blood in your eye and a passion for gin
Hey , goodbye all you punks
Stay young and stay high
Hand me my checkbook
Then I'll crawl out to die
But like a woman in childbirth
Grown ugly in a flash
I've seen magic and pain
Now I'm recycling trash
People died where I performed
People cried when Glass deformed
Shots rang out as the singer yawned
The band played on until the dawn
Lies and drunks and drugs and fools
Tricks and stunts disguise the tools
Was the victim dead , was the blood in pools
Was this not part of show-biz rules ?
They made my dream come true
Where do you walk on sunny times
When the rivers gleam and the buildings shine
How do you feel when the pollen falls
And the summer clothes brighten gloomy halls
And they're all in love
And they're all in love
Where do you fit in pffftt magazine
Where the past is the hero and the present a queen
Just tell me right now-- where do you fit in
With blood in your eye and a passion for gin ?
And they're all in love
And they're all in love
Hey , goodbye all you punks
Stay young and stay high
Hand me my checkbook
And I'll crawl off to die
But like a woman in childbirth
Grown ugly in a flash
I'm seen magic and pain
Now I'm recycling trash
And they're all in love
And they're all in love
And they're all in love
And they're all in love
I told you once and I told you twice
But you never listen to my advice
You don't try very hard to please me
With what you know that should come easy
This could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know
I'm sorry girl but I can't stay
Feeling like I do today
Too much pain , Too much sorrow
I guess I'll feel the same tomorrow
This could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know
I told you once and I told you twice
Someone has to pay the price
Now's your chance to change your mind
Cause I've been gone a long long time
This could be the last time
This could be the last time
Maybe the last time
I don't know
You must have somethin' better to do
Than learn to shoot that gun
You could read some history
See how the West was really won
Kings may come , queens may go
Be wary of desire
For when you think you need it most
That gun will misfire
There's a message in Afghanistan
Opium wins the toss
Charlie Wilson , the communists
They had to take a loss
Kings may live , lose their thrones
The junkie's on the wire
You can arm yourself with nukes and drones
That gun will misfire
Remember me when I am gone
I am the fool who got it wrong
One thing I said you can rely on
That gun will misfire
You'll hear that fatal click
You'll wish you chose a knife
A little toil , a little oil
Might have changed your life
There is a plague not far from here
Who likes to spread his seed
You may be the willing one
Who feels the need to breed
When they play , they fly away
Before they join the choir
But please don't try it , for an easy out
That gun will misfire
Remember me when I am gone
I am the fool who got the ending wrong
One thing I said , you can pin it on
That gun will misfire
You must have somethin' better to do
Than learn to shoot that gun
You coulda read some history
Seen how the West was really won
I'm playing my guitar while my sister bangs the jar
The glass sets up a sound like people laughing
It's going to my brain and it's easing all my pain
I must hear this sound again 'cause time is passing
Mmm
I'm walking by the sea and the shingle sings for me
The crabs are swimming down among the starfish
The rocks all clatter down and the seagulls fly around
But the whole trip rubs it in that time is passing , passing
Find it , I got to hear it all again
My heart has heard the sound of harmony
Blind to it , as my tears fall again
It's only by the music I'll be free
There's something in the whisper of the trees
Millions hear it , still they can't believe
There are echoes of it splashing in the waves
As an empire of dead men leave their graves
Don't listen to people talk , don't listen to 'em selling souls
Don't listen to me or words from men above
Don't hear it in your needs and don't hear it in your greeds
Just hear it in the sound of time a-passing
Find it , I got to hear it all again
My heart has heard the sound of harmony
Blind to it , as my tears fall again
It's only by the music I'll be free
Tommy , can you hear me ?
Can you feel me near you ?
Tommy , can you see me ?
Can I help to cheer you ?
Tommy , Tommy , Tommy , Tommy...
Tommy , can you hear me ?
Can you feel me near you ?
Tommy , can you see me ?
Can I help to cheer you ?
Tommy , Tommy , Tommy....

I think these hands have felt a lot
I don't know , what have I touched ?
I think these eyes have seen a lot
I don't know , maybe they've seen too much
I think this brain has thought a lot
Searching , trying to find a crutch
I think this heart has bled once too often
This time , it's bled a bit too much
Too much of anything is too much for me
Too much , and everything gets too much for me
I can't remember before '
But I know ' was there
My ears let in what I should speak out
Hmmm , there's something in the air
I've overloaded on my way
Bye-bye , you better keep in touch
I think your ears hear a whole lot of music
And like me , you've heard a bit too much
Too much of anything is too much for me
Too much , and everything gets too much for me
I think these hands have felt a lot
I don't know , what have I touched ?
I think these eyes have seen a lot
I don't know , maybe they've seen too much
I think this brain has thought a lot
Searching , trying to find a crutch
I think this heart has bled once too often
This time , it's bled a bit too much
Too much of anything is too much for me
Too much , and everything gets too much for me

Wide awake in the middle of the night
I wonder how she's feeling
Is it just a trick of the light
Or is her ceiling peeling ?
She's sitting up in bed , shaking her head
At a copy of True Confessions
Oh it must seem like a fairy tale
To a woman of her profession
But was I all right ? was I all right?
Did I take you to the height of ecstasy ?
Was I all right ? was I all right?
Did a shadow of emotion cross your face
Or was it just another trick of the light ?
What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this ?
They don't make girls like you no more
And I'd like to get to know you on closer terms than this
But I guess you've heard it all before
Lady of the night
Won't you steal away with me ?
Lady of the night
Won't you steal away with me ?
The money's lying on the floor
She looks at me , shakes her head , and sighs
Out of time , out the door
Red light shining in my eyes
All right ?
But was I all right ?
All right?

Your mother loves her brother
But her brother loves his lover
And his lover is my cover
My one and only other - my angel
My angel Trilby
Who said I will be
What I should still be
Genius would fill me - she loves Hymie
Only one Hymie
No one else on earth could ever blind me - like this
Or even find me - such bliss
If you were gone
You'd still be here
Only one Hymie
Why can't they see that life excites me
This boy ignites me
His family fights me
But he's still here
Only one Hymie
Trying to get through , going to just sit and smile
Trying to get to you , but it's once in awhile
Trying to get through , get through , get through
How could they fear , turn a blind eye
Pack up the sun , 'cause they see I'm tryin'
To get through , get through , get through
Are you really mine , or are you my scene
If I teach you now , do you think you could please
I'm trying to get through , get through , keep on goin' , yeah
He'll raise your weary spirits high
My son will teach your silent hearts
To talk
Every home will have his picture
Pilgrims all will touch his hand
Pinball tables , gold and silver
Altars to the Master's plan
Rio , Paris , New York , London
Moscow , Peking , Tokyo
The world !
A Tommy Camp in every city

Two thousand years
Have I waited
To ask if I have loved you
To know if I have served you
To find if I've obeyed you
To know if I've betrayed you
Then find I can't be perfect
Not even a perfect snake
To know that we are hated
You suffer for my sake
And so I have a chance to love
As you intended
You really lived and died for me
Is the waiting really ended
Two thousand years
Long , long years
Long , long , long , long years
I have waited
Two thousand long , long years
Under my thumb's the girl who once had me down
Under my thumb's the girl who once pushed me around
It's down to me , the diff'rence in the clothes she wears
It's down to me , the change has come , she's under my thumb
Under my thumb's a squirming dog who's just had her day
Under my thumb's a girl who has just changed her ways
It's down to me , the way she does what she's told
It's down to me , the change has come , she's under my thumb
Under my thumb's a Siamese cat of a girl
Under my thumb she's the sweetest pet in the world
It's down to me , the way she does what she's told
It's down to me , the change has come , she's under my thumb
Under my thumb her eyes are just kept to herself
Under my thumb , well , I can still look at someone else
It's down to me , the way she talks when she's spoken to
It's down to me , the change has come , she's under my thumb
Three kids from the neighborhood
Three different lives
Three different ways to be
The identical smiles
We're not the same
But we can talk
We kiss and link our arms
We take a walk
We watch the tide ever way
Carry our ides through the sea
We hear the music
Remember being free
We are unholy trinity
And love forever
But we are the sea
We are the ocean
We are the free
We are unholy trinity

Sting , sting
Don't get stung
You're gonna get stung
The foreman over there hates the gang
The poor people on the porch get it so rough
The truck driver drives like a devil
The policemen - they're acting so tough
They need water
Good , good water
We need water
And I'm sure there ain't one of us here
Who'd say , no to somebody's daughter
No no no no no
Sampson seems sorta sweaty
The draftsmen- they smudged their work
The captain of a ship is swimming
Then just wore off a keen bank clerk
We need water
Good , good water
We need water
And maybe somebody's daughter
Come on , gimme good water
Please don't refuse me , mister
I've seen your daughter at the oasis
And I'm beginning to blister
A Chevrolet just made steam
Your crop is laying fallow
My grass skirt's lost its green
I'm alive , but I don't know how
Gimme good water
Indian Lake is burning
New York's skyline is hazy
The River Thames is turning dry
The whole world is a-blazing
Ah , gimme what I need
Please , water , water , water , water , water , water
Gimme water
Water
Water
Water
And I'm sure there ain't one of us here
Who'd say no to somebody's daughter
Oh , no
Whoa
No , no , no , no , no
No , whoa
The foreman over there hates the gang
The poor people on the porch get it so rough
The truck driver drives like a devil
The policemen , they're acting so tough
They need water , good water
They need water
And I'm sure there ain't one of us here
Who'd say , No , to somebody's daughter
No , no , no , no , no
The foreman over there hates the gang
The poor people on the porch get it so rough
The truck driver drives like a devil
The policemen , they're acting so tough
They need water
Good , good water
They need water
And maybe somebody's daughter
Indian Lake is burnin'
New York's skyline is hazy
The River Thames is turnin' dry
The whole world is blazin'
We need water
Hey , good water
Ooh , e need water
And maybe somebody's daughter
A-gimme , gimme good water
A-gimme gimme gimme good water
A-gimme good water
Please don't refuse me , mister
I've seen your daughter at The Oasis
And I'm beginning to blister
A Chevrolet just made steam
Your crop is laying foul
My grass skirt's lost its green
I'm alive , but I don't know how
I need water
Good , good water
They need water
Gimme , gimme good water
Gimme gimme gimme good water
Gimme gimme gimme good water
C'mon , gimme gimme gimme
Good water
Hey , oh water
C'mon , c'mon gimme water
How can I explain how I feel
I'm like a little kid running at her heel
She's giving me looks like she thinks I'm a snappy dresser
How can I tell what I should plan
I've never kissed a girl or held her hand
She's waiting for me to move , I've got to impress her
I play guitar in a mainstream band
I've got three red jackets and a Fender jazz
I've got Charlie Parker's autograph
The girl I moved with's hung up on grass
She moved her seat next to mine
But I'm just playing for time
I ain't got the guts to let her see the real me
My confidence eroded away
Over hearing what children say
So I'm trying to make myself seem more appealing
I know your man is in to playing jazz bass
I tried that myself but I need more space
Like to soar and fly like the big Birdman
When I met him last week he shook my hand
Every lie I tell weaves another spell , another road that ends up blind
The Bird that shook my hand was a wanted man , I think you knew that all the time
I came so close to having you for me
But I lost you in the fantasy
I pretended to myself that you were mine already
You waited but deep in your eyes
You were watching me so wordly wise
Then you changed the subject and talked about going steady
I've got records and a big hi-fi
I sit and listen to Ella and Basie all night
I played modern jazz of every variety
You could come and listen but we close tonight
We got our folks together
We broke down barriers
We found a dream to dream
We were the carriers
We got rich and famous
Papers at our door
We talked a load of crap
They wanted more
We got a hit
I'm young in my camper van
The world feels old and new
I fear the future man
As I take in the view
Don't know where to head now
Give up ? Go back ?
My friends are all dead now
Or stifled in the sack
Sound round
Feel the ground
Feel the pulse
We have found
Breathe in
Feel the spin
Where's the dream
That we were in ?
Sound round
Feel the ground
Feel the pulse
We have found
Sound round
Feel the ground
Feel the pulse
We have found
Breathe in
Feel the spin
Where's the dream
That we were in ?
Sound round
Feel the ground
Feel the pulse
We have found
I'm young in my camper van
The world feels old and new
I fear the future man
As I take in the view
Come to my house
Be one of the comfortable people
Lovely bright home
We're drinking all night
Never sleeping
Milkman come in !
And you baker
Little old lady welcome
And you shoemaker
Come to this house !
Into this house
Come to this house
Be one of us
Make this your house
Be one of us
You can help
To collect some more in
Young and old people
Let's get them all in !
Come to this house !
Into this house !
Chanting
Ask along that man who's wearing a carnation
Bring every single person
From Victoria Station
Go into that hospital
And bring nurses and patients
Everyone go home and fetch their relations !
Come to this house
Be one of the comfortable people
Lovely bright home
Drinking all night never sleeping
Excuse me sir , there's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more at the door
There's more
We need more room
Build an extension
A colorful palace
Spare no expense now
Come to this house !
Be one of us
Come into this house
Be one of us
Come to this house !
Into this house !
Welcome
Welcome to the camp
I guess you all know why we're here

Put on your eye shades
You know where to put the cork
Hey you getting drunk
So sorry , I got you sussed
Hey you smoking mother nature
This is a bust
Hey hung up old Mr . Normal
Don't try to gain my trust

We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
We're not going to take it
Never did and never will
We're not going to take it
Going to break it
Going to shake it

Your ears are truly sealed
You can't speak either
Your mouth is filled
You can't see nothing
And pinball completes the scene
Here comes Uncle Ernie
To guide you to
Your very own machine

Enlightenment escapes us
Awareness doesn't shape us

Take us to the goal you reached ?
We came here to be like you
And find the world you preached !

WHAT
When I was a baby I hadn't a care in the world
But now I'm a man , my troubles fill my head
When I was five it was good to be alive
But now I'm a man , I wish that I were dead
My how time rushes by
The moment you're born you start to die
Time waits for no man
And your life's spent , it's over before you begin
As I sit here at my window
My life comes back to me
It's been so long since the good days
It's been so long
And I count up all the wasted years
The hopes and the fears
The laughs and the tears
And I wonder , I wonder , I wonder what went wrong
When I was a boy I had the mind of a boy
But now I'm a man , ain't got no mind at all
When I was in my teens I had my share of dreams
But now I'm a man , ain't got no dreams at all
My how time rushes by
The moment you're born you start to die
Time waits for no man
And your life's spent , it's over before you begin
As I sit here at my window
My life comes back to me
It's been so long since the good days
It's been so long
And I count up all the wasted years
The hopes and the fears
The laughs and the tears
And I wonder , I wonder , I wonder what went wrong
Whiskey Man's my friend , he's with me nearly all the time
He always joins me when I drink , and we get on just fine
Nobody has ever seen him , I'm the only one
Seemingly I must be mad , insanity is fun
If that's the way it's done
Doctors say he just a figment of my twisted mind
If they can't see my Whiskey Man they must be going blind
Two men dressed in white collected me two days ago
They said there's only room for one and Whiskey Man can't go
Whiskey Man will waste away if he's left on his own
I can't even ring him cause he isn't on the phone
Hasn't got a home
Life is very gloomy in this little padded cell
It's a shame there wasn't room for Whiskey Man as well
Whiskey Man's my friend , he's with me nearly all the time
He always joins me when I drink , and we get on just fine
Just fine
When big mo comes dont cry
Who are you ?
Who , who , who , who ?
Who are you ?
Who , who , who , who ?
Who are you ?

Who are you ?

I woke up in a Soho doorway
A policeman knew my name
He said You can go sleep at home tonight
If you can get up and walk away
I staggered back to the underground
And the breeze blew back my hair
I remember throwing punches around
And preaching from my chair
Well , who are you ? Who are you ? Who , who , who , who?
I really want to know Who are you ? Who , who , who , who?
Tell me who are you ? Who are you ? Who , who , who , who?
Because I really want to know Who are you ? Who , who , who , who?
I took the tube back out of town
Back to the Rolling Pin
I felt a little like a dying clown
With a streak of Rin Tin Tin
I stretched back and I hiccupped
And looked back on my busy day
Eleven hours in the Tin Pan
God , there's got to be another way
Well , who are you ? Who are you ? Who , who , who , who?
Oh , who are you ? Who are you ? Who , who , who , who?
Come on tell me who are you ? Who are you ? Who , who , who , who?

I know there's a place you walked
Where love falls from the trees
My heart is like a broken cup
I only feel right on my knees
I spit out like a sewer hole
Yet still receive your kiss
How can I measure up to anyone now
After such a love as this ?
Well , who are you ? Who are you ? Who , who , who , who?
Tell me whoa are you(Who are you ? Who , who , who , who?
Oh , I really want to know Who are you ? Who , who , who , who?

I used to check my reflection
Jumping with my cheap guitar
I must have lost my direction
'Cause I ended up a superstar
One-nighters in the boardroom
Petrify the human brain
You can learn from my mistakes
But you're posing in the glass again
Well , who are you ? Who are you ? Who , who , who , who?
Oh , who are you ? Who are you ? Who , who , who , who?
C'mon , tell me , who are you ? Who are you ? Who , who , who , who?

The streets of the future littered with remains
Of both the fools and the so called brains
The whole prediction is enough to kill
But only God knows if it will not or it will
Nobody knows why we fell so flat
Some silly creature said we would never crack
Most would just survive and then bounce back
But the rest are crying Why'd I fall for that crap
Why did I fall for that ?
So many rash promises sincerely made
By people who believed that we were being saved
They made us all believe that we were acting white
But the truth is we have forgotten how we used to fight
Nobody knows why we fell so flat
We are impotent and neutered like whining cats
We have found the piper but we've lost the rats
But the kids are crying Why'd you fall for that dad?
Why did you fall ?
It never rains under my umbrella
Four minutes to midnight on a sunny day
Maybe if we smile the clock will fade away
Maybe we can force the hands to just reverse
Maybe as a word , maybe maybe is a curse
Nobody knows why we fell so flat
We have never been taught to fight or to face up to facts
We simply believe that we'd remain intact
But history is asking why'd you fall for that ?
Why did you fall ?
Why did I fall for that
We'll be fighting in the streets
With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgment of all wrong
They decide and the shotgun sings the song
I'll tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Change , it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold , that's all
And the world looks just the same
And history ain't changed
'Cause the banners , they all flown in the last war
I'll tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
No , no
I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half-alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
For I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do you ?
Yeah
There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are effaced , by-the-bye
And the parting on the left
Is now the parting on the right
And the beards have all grown longer overnight
I'll tip my hat to the new Constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
Then I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again
No , no
Yeah
Meet the new boss
Same as the old boss
We'll be fighting in the streets
With our children at our feet
And the morals that they worship will be gone
And the men who spurred us on
Sit in judgment of all wrong
They decide and the shotgun sings the song
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a bow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
And I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
Don't get fooled again
Change it had to come
We knew it all along
We were liberated from the fold that's all
And the world looks just the same
And history ain't changed
Cause the banners , they all flown in the last war
I'll tip my hat to the new constitution
Take a vow for the new revolution
Smile and grin at the change all around
Pick up my guitar and play
Just like yesterday
And I'll get on my knees and pray
We don't get fooled again
No , no !
I'll move myself and my family aside
If we happen to be left half alive
I'll get all my papers and smile at the sky
For I know that the hypnotized never lie
Do ya ?
There's nothing in the street
Looks any different to me
And the slogans are replaced , by-the-bye
And the parting on the left

Meet the new boss
Same as the old boss
You – you are wasting my time
We are making music we are doing fine
Then a slap in the face takes me back to the starting line
You - your wasting my life
You cannot lose what you have already lost
Your arms are open but your legs are crossed
Save me - save me
I am going down for the third time
Save me - save me
Somebody throw me my next line
Too hot for me to handle
So cold I am getting nowhere
Pinch me to see if I am sleeping
Maybe it is only a nightmare
You - why did it have to be you ?
Of all those girls I had to choose
You win and I lose
You - you with the poisonous eyes
One look and I am hooked
One touch and my goose is cooked
Save me - save me
I am going down for the third time
Save me - save me
Somebody throw me a life line
Too late to change partners
Too late you have got no chance
Too late to change partners
Too late to say I do not dance
You – there is a name for girls like you
You lead me on like a lamb to the slaughter
Then you act like a fish out of water
You - there's a name for girls like you
You have coming on like a steam train
Then you blow me away just like a hurricane
Save me - save me
I am going down for the last time
Save me - save me
Somebody throw me a lifeline
Save me I am falling
From the top of the page to the next line
Save me I am burning
From tips of my toes to my hairline
Too hot for me to handle
So cold I am getting nowhere
Pinch me to see if I am sleeping
Maybe it is only a nightmare
You better you better you bet , ooh
You better you better you bet , ooh
You better you better you bet , ooh
You better you better you bet , ooh
I call you on the telephone
My voice too rough with cigarettes
I sometimes think I should just go home
But I'm dealing with a memory that never forgets
I love to hear you say my name
Especially when you say yes
I got your body right now on my mind
But I drunk myself blind to the sound of old T-Rex Hmmmm
To the sound of old T-Rex oh – and Who's Next
When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet
You better bet your life
Or love will cut you like a knife
I want those feeble minded axes overthrown
I'm not into your passport picture -- I just like your nose
You welcome me with open arms and open legs
I know only fools have needs but this one never begs
I don't really mind how much you love me
Ooh , a little is alright
When you say come over and spend the night
Tonight , tonight
When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet
You better bet your life
Or love will cut you like a knife
I lay on the bed with you
We could make some book of records
Your dog keeps licking my nose
And chewing up all those letters
Saying you better
You better bet your life
You better love me , all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
You better love me , all the time now
You better shove me back into line now
I showed up late one night
With a neon light for a visa
But knowing I am so eager to fight
Can't make letting me in any easier oooh ooh
I know I've been wearing crazy clothes
And I look pretty crappy sometime oooh ooh
But my body feels so good
And I still sing a razor line every time
And when it comes to all night living
I know what I am giving
I have got it all down to a tee
And it's free
When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I love you you say you better
You better you better you bet
When I say I need you you scream you better ooh

I've got a feeling twenty-one
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together
So you think twenty-one
Is going to be a good year
It could be good for me and her
But you and her , no never
I had no reason
To be over optimistic
But somehow when you smiled
I can brave bad weather
What about the boy ?
What about the boy ?
What about the boy ?
He saw it all
You didn't hear it , you didn't see it
You won't say nothing to no one
Ever in your life , you never heard it
Oh , how absurd it , all seems without any proof
You didn't hear it , you didn't see it
You never heard it not a word of it
You won't say nothing to no one
Never tell a soul , what you know is the truth
I've got a feeling twenty-one
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together
I've got a feeling twenty-one
Is going to be a good year
Especially if you and me
See it in together
I had no reason

Uh ... we'd like to carry on now , and play a song originally recorded by Mose Allison , who's really a jazz musician , and I did read something on one of his record covers which said he was a jazz sage. And , uh , quite what that means , I don't know , but , uh—
Just play the tune
laughing And , anyway , we've picked up quite a number of his songs , Eyesight To The Blind, which is on the Tommy album , we picked up from him , and also this song , which I think has got to be one of his best . It's one of his own compositions , which he wrote when he was about forty—
A teenager !
Just a mere teenager , and he called it , Young Man Blues.
Well a young man
Ain't got nothin' in the world these days
I said a young man
Ain't got nothin' in the world these days
Well , you know in the old days
When a young man was a strong man
All the people they stepped back
When a young man walked by
But you know nowadays
